Here we go, Houston, Texas! [cheering] Let’s get this show on the road. Dwayne Johnson here, also known as The Rock, also known as La Roca in Spanish, also known as the sexiest motherfucker alive. It’s not important right now, but what is important that you guys have come together to see one man. The man who hails from a place that many of you know. The Alief area.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n Yes. [chuckles] “The SWAT” as we call it. Many amazing people have come out of the Swat. Lizzo, Beyoncé, Travis Scott. [cheering] And one other person, who you guys did not know has come out of the Swat, is the one and only people’s champ, The Rock! [cheering] Well, just for tonight, I’ve come out of the Swat. But tomorrow I’ll be from some place else. Probably Hawaii. Listen, what is important right now, [chuckles] is that I have the honor of introducing the man who you have come to see. Ladies and gentlemen of Houston, a warm hometown Houston welcome for the man himself. [whistling] The other people’s champion. My boy. Your boy.

I mean, after the last 19 months that we’ve had. I mean, we’re here. We’re together. As a live performer I thought it was over, to be honest. [laughing] And now we’re here. That was the second time I ever thought my career potentially might be over. The first time… [laughing] was right after 9/11.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n Someone named Mohammed. I was like, “It’s not looking good for me out here.” [laughing] [Mo chuckles] Matter of fact, my own family turned on me. [laughing] My own brother looked me dead in my eyes and goes, “Your career is over.” [laughing] I was like, “How could you say some shit like that to me?” “You know I always wanted to be a stand up comedian.” He goes, “Look how they’re talking about us on the news.” “Nobody wants to see a Mohammed on stage telling jokes.” “Your career is over.” I said, “Omar, you’re a pilot.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n Now I’m in a movie with The Rock. In your face, bitch. You know what I mean? [chuckles]\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Wow. Is it over though? [sighs] Is the pandemic over? [sighs] Was it real? [sighs] But what, is it over? No for real, I’m asking. Is it though? [soft grunt] I’m always like laughing and about to cry at any moment inside. I’m like [chuckles and grunts]. Was is real? Is it? You know what’s real? Divorce is real. Divorce… [laughing] Divorce is real as fuck. Divorce is so real. I got divorced in the pandemic. It happened, you know. What are you gonna do? [whistling] We both one guy’s happy.\\r\\n [soft cheering and applause]\\r\\n It’s not like those stories that you hear where a comedian’s like, “Fuck that bitch.” No. It just didn’t work out. You know what I mean? And it’s fine. And when you’re married for so long you’re just use to certain things. I was dead asleep one night. And then I farted so hard. [laughing] I farted so hard I woke up ashamed. Like… [gasps] Like this. [laughing] And I looked over to my left and I apologized. And there was nobody there! [laughs] [laughing] I just turned over and cried. I was like… [sobs] [laughing] I wrote that shit down immediately. I’m like, “This is hilarious.” [sobs] [sobs then laughs] [laughing] Is it real? Was it? Is it real? I don’t know. Fuck. [laughing] It’s how I feel… [grunts] …all the time.\\r\\n Pandemi you know, what the media did to us was, honestly, it feels unforgivable. It really did. It’s like, “Panic!” [screams] “It’s coming!” “What’s coming?” “I don’t know. It’s coming.” [laughing] [shouts] “Three people have it.” “What? Huh?” “It’s coming!” “What’s coming?” “Something that has to do with a bat.” “I don’t know.” “Bats are coming?” “No!” “It came from a bat.” [laughing] “And it’s this thing you can’t see with your naked eye, but it’s coming.” “You’re all gonna die.” [screams] “But don’t be scared.” “Don’t” “What do you mean?” “Huh?” “I’m scared.” “I’m worried.” [chuckles] “Don’t worry, just get Chlorox.” “You’re gonna be fine.” [laughing] “Get as much Chlorox.”\\r\\n [soft applause]\\r\\n “But don’t use the Chlorox… [laughing] …before you use Chlorox on the Chlorox.” “Then you could use the Chlorox, okay.” [laughing] “When you get packages, fucking bathe with the packages.” [laughing] They had us all a bunch of assholes. We’re like… [spraying noise] [laughing] “Amazon came in.” [spraying noise] [laughing] “It’s fine, fan it out. It’s fine.”\\r\\n [soft cheers and applause]\\r\\n [screams] [laughing] “Put on a mask.” “How many masks?” It kept changing. [laughing] “Put on a mask. One mask.”, Fauci said. “One mask is like 33% protection.” “Two masks are like 66% protection.” [laughing] “Three masks are like 97% protection.” And then a plastic bag, just 100%. [laughing] Just kill yourself. Just… [grunts] asphyxiate. “Oh, no, we lost another one to COVID!” [laughing] “Nah, bro, one more bag, bro. He killed himself.” [laughing] [huffs] “Stay home. We figured it out.” “Stay home.” “How long?” “I don’t know.” [laughs] “Monthses, I think.” [laughing] “How many monthses?” “Just monthses, bro, I don’t know.” [laughing] “It’s gonna be monthses.” “How many monthses?” “We don’t know.” [laughing] “You’re supposed to know.” “I know.” “But we don’t know.” “It’s monthses. Just stay home.” “Well, I have to go to work.” “Fuck your job,” they said. [laughing] “Fuck your job.” “What do you mean, fuck my job?” “I don’t have to pay rent?” “Whoa, hold on, take it easy.” [laughing] “Capitalism. Take it easy.” “You still have to p',\n","  'ay your rent.” “Oh, so, hold on, but then I have to go to well, then, send me money. You know what just send me money.” “No, whoa, what are you, a crackhead, bro?” [laughing] “We can’t send you money if if” “What are you talking about? We can’t send you” “Why you stuttering a lot, bro?” “Just send me this money.” “We we don’t have any money, okay.” [soft laughing] “We don’t have any” “What are you talking about?” “We send you money, but that’s how this works, okay.” “We send you money and you allocate it for different buckets. Right. You got Social security, you got Medicare, Medicaid, there’s a lot of buckets.” “And I’m sure you have a rainy day fund.” “Bro, you gotta have a rainy day fund.” “And it’s pouring outside.” “Fucking full blown hurricane season.” [laughing] “Seven hurricanes hitting at the same time.” “Send me some fucking money.” “I have a confession, we’re broke. Okay.” [laughing] “What do you mean you’re broke? You’re the federal government.” [laughs] “I know, I know.” I know, we’re in debt, okay.” [chuckles] “We’re in debt, all right, it’s” [laughing] “It’s a lot of it’s debt, okay.” “How much debt?” “We’re just minus okay. We’re just…” [laughing] “We’re just” “I know what debt means, bro, just how much minus?” “It’s a lot of minuses.” [laughing] “So much minus. A lot of minus.” “Just spit it out. How much is it?” “Twenty trillion dollars.” [laughing] “Twenty trillion dollars?” “Who’s balancing this cheque book?” [laughing] “MC Hammer? Who’s managing this whole situation?” “How did you get 20 trillion dollars minus?” “Killing Brown people is so expensive.” [audience cries out in surprise] “Oh!” “It’s so expensive.” [loud sigh] “Just so much. So as you can see, we can’t send you money.” “If we’re in minus. Overdraft fees are piling up. We can’t… [laughing] send you out of minus.” [laughs] “What, Kyle?” “The stock market is gonna fail?” “Holy shit, Kyle. Heat up the printer.” “Heat up the fucking printer.” [laughing] “Make three trillion dollars appear.” “And let’s funnel it into the Ponzi scheme that is the stock market.” [soft laughing] Because the stock market is a direct reflection of American hearts everywhere. If the arrow’s going down that means hearts and souls of Americans everywhere is also going down. “But look it’s working, it’s going up!” “Americans are happy again.” “It’s going up.” [laughing] “It’s sky rocketing!” “Wait, wait, wait. How the fuck is it sky rocketing?” “We’re all at home. I thought…” [laughing] I…\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n “How is it…”\\r\\n [soft laughing and applause]\\r\\n “How…” “How is this thing going up?” “I thought it was all based off of revenue streams and quarterly earnings. And nobody’s working.” “I get Amazon. Shit.” [laughs] “Everybody is at home ordering, this should be sky rocketing.” “Well, fuck you, Jeff Bezos, and thank you, Jeff Bezos, all at the same time. “Like, but how is this still going up, bro?” “I thought this was all based off of money coming in. Everybody’s at home.” “Look man, shut the fuck up, okay!” [laughing] “Just look at the arrow. God, can’t you just shut shut your mouth and just be happy that the arrow’s going up?” “No, I can’t, bro. We need money.” “Look here’s $1,200. Hush money.” “Shut the fuck up.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n “Thank you. That’ll last me a week. I appreciate that.” [laughs] “Stop trying to distract me.” “How the fuck is this arrow going up, though, for real?” “Homelessness is at an alltime high.” “Look, aliens are real. Chew on that for a little bit.” “What?” [laughing] “You talk to them?” “Yeah, bro, all the time, it’s crazy.” “Just look at the arrow, all right.” “No, still, like, so many unemployed.” “Fifty million people unemployed. How the fuck is the arrow going up, bro?” “Look, Jada cheated on Will Smith. Chew on that for a little bit.” [laughing] “What?” “Why, Jada, why?” [laughing] “What happened?” “Something about entanglements, I don’t know, it’s crazy.” “Just look at the arrow.” “Just look at the fucking arrow.” “No, for real, stop trying to distract me, bro. How is this arrow still going up, okay? Please explain yourself.” “Look, I’ve got a hot tip for you, okay.” “Cryptocurrency.” [laughing] “What the fuck is cryptocurrency?” “It’s these little people inside of a computer.” “And they’re just mining. They’re just mining for these digital coins, okay.” “What you do is, you move the real fake money over to the… [laughing] over to the more real fake money.” [laughing] “And what you do is, you just move, once you have more real fake money, you move your real fake money over here” “and you just keep doing that.” “I’m so confused.” “Hey, man, I’ve got another hot tip for you. NFT’s.” “What the fuck is a NFT?” [shouts and laughing]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n “It’s a blockchain of ownership…” “You know what, I’m just gonna put a plastic bag over my head. Fuck this shit.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n [cheering] Is it real? COVID’s real. I had it. Dave Chappelle gave me COVID. That’s right. [laughing] Well, that was the second time. [laughing] But the first time, he hits me up right at the beginning of the pandemic. He’s like, “Say, Mo, what are you doing?” I’m like, “I don’t know if you’ve been watching the news, bro.” “I’m at home, dog, that’s what I’m doing.” [laughing] “That’s what you do. We’re all at home. I don’t know if you were watching.” He was like, “Yeah, you can’t let them break us.” I’m like, “We’re broken, bro.” “The whole country is broken.” He was like, “That’s why I’m hitting you up.” “I’m gonna do these shows out in this cornfield in Ohio.” I was like, “I don’t know, man, this doesn’t sound very, I’m not sure, you know.” He was like, “No, no.” “We’re gonna test everybody every three days.” “It’s gonna be very safe. We’re gonna do the best we can. Nothing is guaranteed, of course.” “We’re gonna do the best that we can, every” I was like, “You have testing machines, bro? Th',\n","  'is is the beginning of the pandemic.” [laughing] “Like, how did you get testing machines?” He just went nuts, He was like, “Say, nigga, I’m Dave Chappelle. Of course I got these”\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n I was like, “Good point.” Really good point. So we go, I go to Ohio. And it was a amazing run of shows, like, almost four months of doing these shows. And we almost made it, but we had outbreaks and we had to stop it. And he made it into a documentary film. It’s an incredible documentary film. I saw it at Radio City Music Hall. It was the first time that I got to see it. And then I watched it and I was like, “Wait, the end of the movie makes it look like I ruined the whole fucking party.” [laughing] I got COVID and the whole thing had to shut down because I was being a bitch. I was like, “Wait, hold on a second.” I walked up to Dave. I’m like, “Dave, the way you edited this, you made it look that Mohammed was the villain in the whole situation.” [laughing] “That’s not the truth, bro. I didn’t do” He’s like, “Ah, man, nobody’s gonna think this.” And right after he walks away Bradley Cooper walks up. He’s like, “Man, this is really fucked up how you just ruined the… [laughing] ruined the party in Ohio.” I was like, “It wasn’t me.” “An awardwinning film maker is saying that this is what it looks like.” “Oh, no!” And it wasn’t my fault. It was this tiny little lady. She was really small. And she was handsy. Really handsy. [laughing] And she was touching me all the time. “Hi, Mo.” [giggles] “Hi.” [laughing] Just doing this all the time. I’m like, “Hey, stop touching me right now.” “First of all, it’s a pandemic. Like, I don’t you that well enough” “and stop touching me, like” And then she fakecoughed in my face. [fake coughs] Like this. And I was like, “I love dark humor, but that’s [laughing] That’s not funny!” “It’s not funny, bitch. It’s not funny.” And then she tested positive three days later. [audience sympathizes] I was like, “I knew she was Israeli. I knew it.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n I knew it. I knew it. They were having a meeting in Hollywood. They were like, “This Palestinian’s getting too powerful.” [laughing] “Just send him this unassuming little gremlin to try and kill him with COVID.” I survived, bitch! I survived! [laughing] That was the first time I got COVID. [laughing] The second time, Dave Chappelle calls me again. [laughing] Saying, “Man, what you doing?” I’m like, “I’m recovering from COVID.” [laughing] He’s like, “I’m gonna do these shows in Austin. Joe Rogan is gonna be on it.” “It’s gonna be dope.” “You should join.” I’m like, “Dave, I don’t know if this really worked out for me the first time.” [laughing] And he was like, “Nah, man, this is gonna be different.” “We gonna test every day.” “Last time we were only testing every three days. We’re gonna test every day.” “So we gonna catch that ho and put her in a closet.” [laughing] “You’d be straight.” I was like, “Fuck it, let’s do it.” [huffs] [laughing] We’re like ten days into doing shows and Dave walks up to me and he’s like, “Hey, man, I got this joint from JayZ.” I was like, “Word?” He was like, “Yeah, I got this joint from JayZ.” I was like, “JayZ’s here?” He was like, “Nah, man, JayZ has a weed company and he sent me these joints.” [laughing] “You wanna go? Let’s go roll around your car and let’s smoke this together.” I’m like, “Shit, Dave Chappelle has a joint from JayZ asking Mo Amer if he wants to smoke this shit, you’re damn right, I’m gonna smoke the shit out of this joint.”\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Obvious. So then we’re cruising and then he lights up the joint. And I should’ve known better! Because he took a hit and then he goes… [coughs] like this. [laughing] I was like, “You okay, Dave?” He was like, “Yeah, yeah, I’m fine.” “I’m fine. This JayZ weed makes you do JayZ impressions like…” [coughs] “Djeah!”\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n I took the joint. I took a couple of hits. I was like, [coughs] “… djeahhova!” [chuckles] [laughing] Smoke it. We laughed. It was a great ride. And then I dropped Dave off because it was like 30 minutes until show time. And then I started texting him, I was like, “Say, bro, you want me to swoop you up?” “Is there special guests, should I come later?” And he went silent. And I was like, “This is weird.” “Dave, we just dropped you off, bro. This is really odd.” And then friends started texting me. They haven’t heard from him in, like, weeks. They were like, “Hey, man, is Dave okay?” I’m like, “Yeah, Dave’s okay.” “You don’t know him, that’s my boy.” [laughing] “What are you talking about?” “We just hanging out.” And then they sent me a link. I was like, “What is this link?” So I touched the link and it opens up. And it’s TMZ front page news, “Dave Chappelle tests positive for COVID.” [sympathy from audience] Then I was like, “This can’t be true!” And then I was like, “Shit, It’s TMZ, they’re always right, these motherfuckers.” [laughing] I was like, “How did they know before I knew?” “I just dropped off Dave.” “He called them before he called me.” “Fuck. That’s fucked up, bro.” And then he tried to deny it. I walked up to him and I was like, “Dave, it’s fucked up you gave me COVID a second time.” And he goes, “There’s no way to really prove that, Mo.” [laughing] [laughs] I was like, “Bro, the first day you tested positive I was smoking a joint with you.” “Minutes before you tested positive.” And he got silent and he just goes, “I’m sorry I gave you COVID, bro.” [laughing] [huffs] And then he goes, “Walk it off, at least it’s not AIDS.” And he’s just walking around like this.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n [Mo laughs] Is it over? [chuckles] Is it? [grunts and laughs] [laughing] [laughs] So I am done. I had that shit twice. Okay. Fauci, “Only seven people in the world have ever gotten it twi” Bullshit! I’m special, but I’m not that fucking special, Fauci. [l',\n","  'aughing] So I’m done. I had it twice. And I’m vaccinated. I’m over it. I’m over it. I got the Pfizer vaccine. [cheering] That’s what I want. Everybody has their favorites, but I went with Pfizer. I want… [laughing] I want like a German scientist making my shit, you know what I’m saying? [laughing] I want the guy like, [in fake German accent] “Yavi, hows the Pfizer? Ya!” “We knew he was coming out of Wuhan.” “The COVID. And we are way ahead of schedule.” “Ya! We have the vaccine! The Pfizer!” That’s the one I want. That’s what I\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n The what?\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n “Yaza!” [chuckles] “Hmm, ya, iz good, ya, we have the Pfizer.” [chuckles] [laughing] “You have the Pfizer? I have the Pfizer.” [laughing] [chuckles] I’m not doing Johnson & Johnson. I’m not doing that. [huffs] I don’t even use their regular products. [laughing] And they make too many for my comfort, bro. [laughing] You want me to tell you like, “What’s in the Johnson & Johnson?” “I don’t know, man, like we just started off with a little snake venom in there.” [laughing] “And then we just added some Johnson & Johnson baby powder to thicken it up a bit.” [laughing] “Some Johnson & Johnson baby oil to loosen her up a bit.” “Then we put a goddamn baby in there.” [laughing] “Just a whole fucking baby.” “And we finished it off with a little wild turkey to give it that pop!” “Know what I mean?”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n “How many shots do I take?” “No shots, we just pass it mouth to mouth.” “You just come on now…” [laughs]\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n It’s so absurd. I [huffs] It’s so absurd, like [huffs] Like, vaccines having accents is so ab [chuckles] What’s Moder [huffs] What’s Moderna? [imitating Mexican accent] [laughing] “You got that derna, bro?” “We give you one shot then you Crip Walk out this bitch.” You know what I mean. Like, bra, lets do it?” [laughing] Like I’m g [chuckles] That derna. [chuckles] [grunts and exhales sharply] [laughing] Fuck! [laughing] That’s how I feel inside. [soft laughing] I do. That’s how I feel inside. All the time. Fuck. [laughing] All the time. I’m just… [grunts] fuck. [laughing] [grunts] Fuck. And fuck is just not a potent enough word, to be honest with you. It’s not strong. Once you speak another language, you realize, you realize that the English language is just like a newborn, you know. [laughing] It is. It’s a new language. Like, I speak Arabic. Arabic is an ancient language. [sighs] English is like it’s baby. It wants to grow up and be Arabic one day and it’s just… [laughing] It is, it’s just…\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n No, it’s fine. It’s just a baby. It’s just a baby. It’s not a It lacks a lot of depth. It’s just not, it’s just not very strong, like “fuck”, it’s nothing. It’s an exclamation point, you know. Even greetings in Arabic takes so long, you know. [soft laughing] Greetings are like, “Peace be upon you.” “And may peace be upon you.” “And the mercy of the divine be upon you.” “And may the mercy of the divine be upon you.” “And may divine light be with you.” “May it be unto you as well.” “May it protect you and your entire linea” “Hey, man, can I get this pack of cigarettes, bro, and get out of here?”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n It’s a lot. It’s a lot. In English, it’s, “Hi.” [laughs] That’s it. It’s over. [laughing] [chuckles] It’s over. [chuckles] “What’s up? The sky?” [mock giggles] That’s it, there’s nothing else. [laughs] It’s nothing. [laughs] So when somebody curses you in English, sincerely, you could probably walk away 99.9% of the time if you didn’t get emotionally charged. Really. It’s an oldie but a goodie. “Hey, fuck you!” “I don’t wanna fuck you.” [laughing] And you could, just walk away. [soft laughing] “Hey, go fuck yourself!” “You know what, man? I’ve been really tense lately.” [laughing] “And maybe what I need to do is go fuck myself.” [laughing] “Hey, you’re a motherfucker.” “Not my mom, but…” [laughing] “My exwife did have child from a previous marriage, so I guess I am a motherfucker.” [soft laughing] “And by the way, your father, biggest motherfucker of them all, technically.” [laughing and a whoop] “Hey, you’re an asshole!” “You know what, the eye cannot see itself.”\\r\\n [laughing]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n “And I cannot see when I’m being an asshole, so thank you for making me a better person.” And just walk away. “Hey! You’re a pussy!” “Yeah, I’ll take that.” I don’t know why “pussy” always insinuates weakness. Pussy is metaphorically and physically very strong. [loud cheering] So strong!\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n It’s true. Absolutely true. It’s so strong. It can have a baby. Human life. [whoop] Pounds of human flesh can come out of this little, tiny hole. Pop! And it can have two at the same time. Pop! Pop! [laughing] It can have three. Pop, pop, pop. [laughing] And then it regenerates… like this. [laughing] Almost. Exactly how it was. Almost. [laughing] Almost. Exactly how it was. Maybe if you laugh or cough, you piss on yourself, but otherwise… [laughing] Otherwise, it’s there. Ready for you once again. [laughs] [laughing] [laughing] My friend, Chris, passed a kidney stone out of his dick hole. [laughing] He damn near died, okay. [laughing] He was like, “Oh, God, what’s happening to me?” He was like, “Somebody shoot me!” And it was a grain of sand that came out of his dick hole. Women, “Pop! Pop!” Come back. [laughing] Little grain of sand… [groans] [laughing] You be a dick. I’ll be a pussy any day of the week.\\r\\n [loud cheering and applause]\\r\\n [cheering and whistling]\\r\\n Arabic curse words. [soft laughing] They’re really graphic. [laughing] They’re so graphic I don’t even use them. Honestly, I just… We’re gonna start here and build up. [laughing] Like “Kes Emak”, which means… [murmurs] …”Fuck your mother’s pussy!” [laughing] Very specific. [laughing] [Mo huffs] We take that to another level. “Kes Emak Eli Nafadek” whic',\n","  'h means… [laughing] Which me two people, “Yeah, I know what that means.” [laughing] [chuckles] Everybody else is on their toes, “What does it mean?” [laughing] It mea “Kes Emak Eli Nafadek” which means, “Fuck the pussy you slithered out of!” Wow! [shocked laughing] [Mo laughs] Astaghfirullah I know, it’s crazy. [laughing] [indistinct] Everyone saw the baby fall out. It’s a visual curse word, that one. [laughing] This is one of my personal favorites, “Yela3n Tarekhek”, Which means, which means, “Damn your entire history.” [laughing] “My greatgrandmother?” “No, bitch, from the beginning of time…” [laughing] “…to present day and everything in between and in the future, fuck your DNA.” [laughing] Astaghfirullah, I don’t need this. It’s a lot. Even Western hand gestures. Not that big of a deal. “Uh, fuck you bro, uh.” [laughing] In England it’s a reverse peace sign. Very confusing. [in fake English accent] “Oh, fuck off, oh.” [laughing] And they try to be like, “No, it’s from the war, yeah.” I’m like, “Shut the fuck up, okay. [laughing] “It’s not that cool.” Arabs, we go to another level. We go sideways, we go “BeTizik”, like this. [laughing] BeTizik, like that. BeTizik, like this. A little pop…\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n BeTizik, like that. [laughing] Little wiggle. BeTizik, like that. BeTizik, like… [laughs] This means “in your ass.” That’s what this means. [laughing] That’s what… [laughs] [laughing] And if there’s any confusion, you just put the other hand up like this and you go BeTizik, like this. [laughing] And you wiggle it. You wiggle it, all up in the ass, that’s right!\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n I feel like a lot of people are gonna be leaving here, like, “Hey, Kyle.” “Yeah.” BeTizik bro! [laughing] [Mo laughs] [laughing] Fuck! [soft laughing] [grunting] [soft laughing] [laughs and soft grunts] [laughing] [in Mexican accent] …bro. [soft laughing] Mexicano’s, bro. I love Mexicano’s.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Let me say, growing up in Alief, you can’t… [whoop and cheers] we can’t. You can’t… You grew up around Mexicano’s. You do. And they always sound like they’re in pain. [in fake Mexican accent] “Come on, bro, let’s hang out.” [laughing] “You all right?” “Yeah, I’m doing fine, bro.” “Are you sure?” [soft laughing] Love Mexicano’s. They’re resilient people, hard working people. And it’s fucked up they even started a conversation about putting a wall up. Shit, this never worked it human history. And you keep repeating the same bullshit. First of all, it’s Mexicans. Most creative people I know. Huh? It’s like…\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n So creative, the Palestinians were taking notes and shit. When El Chapo snuck out of that tunnel with a motorcycle, we’re like, [in Arabic accent] “Hey, Abdallah, come watch, bro.” [laughing] “Hey, he put a motorcycle inside a tunnel, bro?” “We need to do this back home.” Ya Habibi Ya Allah. [laughing] You’re not gonna stop Mexicans, bro. It’s not gonna work. Put up a wall and they’ll just zipline back into the country and shit. They’ll be like, [in Spanish] “Ready, José, I’m ready.” Push me, motherfucker. Come on, go fuck your mother.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n [in English] They’d be like, “Did he make it?” “I don’t know, bro.” [laughing] “I think he missed the trampoline.” [laughing] “Ziplining, this is so tricky.” [laughing] “Timing is everything, bro.” [laughs] [laughing] If I was Mexican living in Mexico, I’d flip the whole script. I would. I’d be like, “You know what, bro?” “We’re building a wall, okay.” [laughing] “We’re building a wall. You can’t come to Cancùn no more, puto. How about that?” [laughing and cheering] How about that? That’s it. You’d have the White girls You’d have White girls crying all across America. [laughing] They’re like, [imitating a girl] “Oh, my God.” “I just wanted to go to Cancùn for Spring Break.” “Why are they so racist? I don’t understand.” [laughing] “Now I have to go to Puerto Vallarta.” [laughing] That’s also in Mexico. [girl voice] “Oh, my God!” [laughing]\\r\\n [soft laughing and applause]\\r\\n Love Mexicano’s. I love doing accents. It’s a lot of fun, you know. When you can do them like, [in fake Mexican accent] “Come on, let’s hang out, it’s” It’s fun. The German’s fun. [in fake German accent] “Ya, ooh, it’s lovely here.” [laughing] I mean, I fuck with them all day. Russians though, I don’t fuck with Russians. [cheers and laughing] I don’t fuck with anybody that talk like this, [in fake Russian accent] “What you say to me?” [laughing] “You fuck me, my family? What you say to me?” [laughing] I’m like, “I’m good, bra. I don’t trust you.” [nervous laugh] [laughing] A Russian guy in an Adidas tracksuit. I’m good. [in fake Russian accent] “What you say to me? You fuck around?”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n “What you say?” “I’m good, bra.” “I’m goo…” I don’t fuck with anybody with a Russian accent and I don’t fuck with anybody with cauliflower ears. [laughing] I don’t fuck with them. And if you talk like this and you have cauliflower MMA ears, I don’t fuck with you either, bro. [laughing] That’s how I knew Khabib Nurmagomedov was gonna be the greatest MMA fighter of all time.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n All time.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n [in fake Russian accent] “He talk like this. And he has the ears.” Fuck that, I’m not fucking with you, bro. You’re a real one. And the way he talks is terrifying. [Russian accent] “Oh, you think you’re real? You think you’re from streets?” “I grow up in real mountain.” Like, “What does that mean, bro?” [laughing] “What does that mean?” “What do you mean you grew up there?” “What did you do there?” [laughs] He’ll say wild shit like, “Oh, yeah, you want to fight?” “I’m gonna change his face.” [laughing] “What is he, Potato Head, bro? You can’t do this.” [laughing] You can’t fuck with him. The guy The man wrestled bears as an eightyearold. This is, you can really look this up. He wrest',\n","  'led bears as an eightyearold child. The only people that would do this, is Dagestani’s. Because there’s levels to being Russian. There’s like regular Russian, there’s Chechnyan, and there’s Dagestani’s! It’s a whole another level, where they wrestle bears, apparently. And from childhood. What the fuck are you talking about? His father, God rest his soul, were the greatest coaches of all time. And how did that conversation even happen? Like he walked up to his dad like, [in fake Russian accent] “Daddy.” [laughing] “Daddy, I really want to be great champion.” “Daddy, please, please, train me, Daddy.” Like, “No, son, you’re not ready.” “No, I’m ready. Please, please.” “Train me, Daddy.” “Okay.” “I go get bear. Let’s see.” [laughing] Brought a bear into the house. What did his mom say? “Hey, honey, what you doing with bear?” “I know, I know.” “Relax, bear, relax.” [laughing] “I bring bear. Okay.” [laughs] “I bring bear. Bear gonna wrestle Khabib.” “Khabib one day will be great champion.” “Defeat racist leprechaun in the future.” [laughing] “Save Islam. Alhamdulillah. Come on.” [cheering and whistling] [huffs] Don’t fuck with Russians. Germans, I’ll fuck with them all day. [in fake German accent] “Ooh, ya, it’s wonderful.” [laughing] I did that accent at my first special and a lot of people messaged me like, “Hey, man, you sound like that fat caterpillar from A Bug’s Life.” [laughing] I was like, “No, I don’t.” And then I watched it and I was like, “Ah, shit, I do sound like that fat” It’s like, [German accent] “Ya, look at my wings. I’m a beautiful butterfly.” [laughs] [laughing] [Mo] Whatever. [grunts] [laughing] It’s such a blessing to be together. Listen, let me tell you something. I sincerely, I am mad at what they did to us. I really am. The fear that they created. And the division they created. It’s fucking infuriating. “Who you voting for? Red or blue?” What am I, Bloods or Crips? That’s what I heard. That’s all I heard. All you are gangsters. Okay. Okay, all of you are gangsters. I’m with the people. Always will be with the people. That’s what it is about for me. When the hurricane came through, my neighbor, Scott, redneck Scott, this guy is the best. Okay. He’s always prepared. So I’m never prepared, because I know he’s prepared. [laughing] He’s always like, “Yeah. I got generators. Hell yeah, I got generators.” “Fuck, yeah, Mohammed, I got you, baby.” You know. [laughing] When I came through he hooked me up, bro. I plugged into the side of his house and took that extension cord all the way across that culdesac and plugged my shit in. And that’s what it’s about, bro. They’re trying to separate us, but the fact is Mohammed’s in Texas get along with redneck Scotts all day.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Fuck what you talking about. Fuck what you talking about. That’s the honest truth. People try to just push this particular agenda and it’s not, I do believe in us. I do. I believe in us and then and then I travel and then I go to an airport and I realize how fragmented we really are. We suck as the human race. We suck. [laughs] We’re all in our own bubbles. Nobody’s paying attention to anybody else. Everybody just You’ll see this in an airport. You’d be walking and all of a sudden the person in front of you just stops and just looks up. “What’s up there?” “I’ll tell you what’s behind you, bitch.” “Thousands of people.” [laughing] “Trying to get where they want to go.” “That’s what the fuck is going on.” “What the hell is wrong with you?” “Get the fuck out of the way, all right.” [soft laughing] If you’re travelling with a carryon with no wheels on it, you’re an asshole, okay. [laughing] You just have them all over your shoulder. You’re a fucking mess. [panting] It’s sliding off. “Oh, sorry.” [panting] Wheels exist. What’s the matter with you? [soft laughing] If you have a carryon with only two wheels, this is what you look like, “Hi.” [giggles] Look how much square footage you’re taking behind you. Why the fuck are you doing this? “Hi.” [giggles] [fake laughs] [laughing] What the fuck are you doing? Four wheels exist, man. This is what you look like in four wheels. Like a smart, intelligent human being. You can go forward. You can go backwards on that whore. You can juke a motherfucker and just keep going. [laughing] You have a baby, you put him on top of it and you keep it cruising. [laughing] Now if you have a four wheel carryon and you only use two wheels, you’re probably the biggest asshole of them all. [laughing] We can’t even read numbers. We get to the boarding gate and they’re like, “Boarding…” “Boarding group one.” [high pitched voice] “I’m in seven, can I go?” [giggles] “Well, what he” “I’m in eight since seven’s going.” “Get the fuck out of the way. What are you doing?” [laughing] Then you get on the plane and here comes the people with no wheels on their bags. [panting] Just clotheslining every other person. [thumping noises] [laughing] They have no clue, they just… [panting] And here comes the assholes with two wheels on their bags. Just dragging it behind them… [laughing] …and they’re getting stuck every other seat. “Sorry, sorry.” [fake laughs] “Sorry.” [fake laughs] Turn it around, whore, and see where you’re going.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n Use your eyes. Maneuver. [sighs] Drives me insane. [laughs] Flight attendants, all due respect… [whoop] Well, I would wait to finish the bit, bro. [laughs] [laughing] It’s not good. You’re not saving anyone, all right. You take your job way too seriously. [laughs] [laughing] Somebody has an issue, you just go, “Is there a doctor here? Because I don’t know what I’m doing. Please, somebody.” [laughing] If you have a little bag and it’s a bulkhead, and you have it on the floor, oh, shit. [loud breathing] “We have to put this bag over here.” They’ll shortcircuit on you. “We have to put this bag up top, okay. Just for take of',\n","  'f. And they will give it to you immediately after takeoff, okay.” “Well, then, if you gonna give it to me after takeoff, immediately after takeoff, then why the fuck have I got to move it in the first place?” “Just in case we have an emergency exit situation.” “Wait, we’re gonna exit the plane?” “At like 150 miles an hour?” “What the fuck are you talking about?” “No, no, no, we have to move the bag.” “According to the FAAAAA.” [imitates explosion] [laughing] Shut down. God damn shut down. God, the safety announcements. Oh, my God. “Put on your seatbelt, everybody.” “Because that’s what’s gonna save your life. Okay.” “Yes, a seatbelt from 35,000 feet… [laughing] …to pummel into your imminent death. Okay.” “On a floating rock in space.” “That’s what’s gonna save you, is a seatbelt.” No. They just want your ass in the seat after the plane crashes. They don’t want to have to hire a thirdparty company to look for your bitch ass. [laughing] That’s all it is. They don’t. They just want to get there after the crash, “Adams 3F. There he is, yup.” [laughs] [laughing] “Well, most of him, right.” [laughs] [laughing] It’s all they want. [huffs] Because if they really thought the seatbelt was gonna save your life, they would check every single person as if it’s a roller coaster ride, right. They’d be like, “You’re good. You’re good. You’re good.” “You goo Oh, you almost died, Ralph!” [laughing] “You almost died.” They don’t do that shit. They just walk by. “You’re good. You’re fine. Fine.” [laughing] One flight attendant started to argue with me, “No, Mo, what if we’re having a crash landing and we have real bad turbulence, you could fly up and you could break your neck!” I’m like, “That’s what I want. I want to break my neck.” “I want to be the motherfucker like this while everybody’s screaming for their lives. That’s what I want.” And while everybody’s like, “Oh, my God! Were gonna die!” I’m already dead. I’m good to go. [laughing] Just smacking motherfuckers with no wheels on their bags. [smacking noises] [laughing] That’s what I want. [soft laughing] [huffs] Yes, I remember, if we lose cabin pressure, me first, fuck the baby. [laughing] The little oxygen thing comes down. Me first, fuck the baby. Not my rule. Your rule. [laughing] Flew in from New York to Houston. Okay. I live here, but we flew in from New York to Houston and there’s not a single body of water in sight. But we have to worry about this flotation device, everybody. You put the thing on over and you buckle up the front. And then you pull the string… [swoosh noise] like that. And it will inflate. But if it doesn’t inflate, don’t panic! There’s a straw right here. [laughing] That only, apparently, requires one breath. One magical breath. They make this shit look so easy. Just… [blows] “You’re fine everybody, you’re fine.” Bitch, have you ever tried to inflate anything manually in your whole life? [laughing] I did my nephew’s pool party. I damn near died doing his floaties. [laughing] You’re telling me in the middle of a crash landing, we’ll be like… [screams and blows] [laughing] Dead. [laughing] Don’t worry, there’s a second and third layer of protection, okay. There’s a little flickering light, okay. It’s not even a light. It’s a reflective light the size of a dime, I shit you not. The size of a dime and a whistle. Okay. In the vast, echoy, reflective oceans of the Earth, this is how we’re gonna find your bitch ass… [mock whistle noise] “I’m right here.” [mock laughs] [whistle noise] “I’m right here.” [mock laugh] [whistle noise] “You haven’t found the Malaysia plane.” [laughing] “An entire jumbo jet, bitch.”\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n You’re gonna find my bitch ass, just floating around… [whistle noise] “I’m right here.” [whistle noise] “I’m right here.” You just told all the ocean’s predators your exact location. You’re dead. BeTizik is what I’m saying. [grunts]\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n [grunting and laughs] [laughs] [laughing] Fuck! [laughing] For the first time, for the first time I ever felt this way in my life. I’m a refugee that came to America, I’m an American citizen, of course, now. But, you know, for the first time everybody that was making fun of Texas in California, right in the middle of the pandemic, “Oh, we need to go to Texas.” Yeah? “You need to come here?” For the first time I felt this way, “Go back to where you came from, son of a bitch.” [laughing] “You’re fucking up our real estate.”\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n “Go back home.” That’s how I feel. That’s how… I was like, “I get why they do it. It felt good, a little bit. It felt good.” [soft laughing] I am an ArabAmerican. That’s what I am. Didn’t do it. Yup.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n PalestinianArabAmer This is… [cheering and whistling] Listen. Thank you. All right, let’s start that party. Let’s do it. Here’s the thing. I’m not doing that for applause. I did that just to tell you that’s how you identify yourself. I am an ArabAmerican. That’s how it works here in America. If you’re not White, you have something before American. [laughing] Unless when I’m buying a gun. That’s the only time. When you’re buying a gun in Texas, the first question is, “Are you hispanic?” Super racist. “No.” [laughs] Next, “Are you AfricanAmeric” “No.” [laughs] And then there, has no ArabAmerican. I was like, you know what, fuck it, “I’m White as fuck today.” “Give me that double barrel, 12 gauge shot gun, baby.” [laughing] But all the other times, all the other times, I’m ArabAmerican. You’re not White in America, you have something before American. That’s how it works out. That’s just the way it is. [laughs] Okay. Unless you’re White. You’re just White. Everybody else, something right before American. Even Natives. Natives are natives. Native Americans. We got to identify… [laughing] …the Native Americans. African Americans. Most of my Black friends have never been t',\n","  'o Africa. Nonetheless, they’re African Americans anyway. MexicanAmericans, AsianAmericans, and so forth and so on. Unless you’re White. If you’re White, you just sprouted from the corn fields of Ohio. [laughing] And you just spread across this great land. Unless it’s Saint Paddy’s day, then you’re like, “Oh, shit, my greatgranddaddy was a quarter Irish.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n [huffs] That’s what I am though, an ArabAmerican. And I got to say, as an ArabAmerican, I find it really fascinating to see our culture spreading throughout the West. Really fascinating. It is.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n It’s pretty damn cool. Like, if you don’t know what a hookah is, you’re like culturally ignorant. And if you don’t know what a hookah is… “You don’t know what a hookah is, Denise? Where have you been?” [giggles] “It’s like this bong, but it’s not. It’s like so ornate and it has all these different tobaccos flavors. And then there’s this pipe that comes out. And you just prrr.” “Blow it out, it’s so We can get two pipes and we can brrr together, Denise. Oh, my God.” [laughs] And then White people saw this, which is amazing. You got to give it up. They distilled it into a battery and put a cartridge on top of it with some mysterious liquid that nobody’s questioning. [laughing] Everybody just walk around like… [snorts] [growly exhale] [laughing] “It’s perfectly healthy.” “Bro, I’ve never seen that much smoke come out of a hookah.” [laughing] “Much less this little device.” “You’re changing weather climates on a regular basis.” “What the fuck is going on?” “No, it’s healthy.” [mock laughs] [snorts and growly exhale] “It can’t be, bro. It’s a metal with some battery hooked up to some metal. I’m sure you’re fucked.” “Please stop doing this.” [laughing] That’s the first public service announcement. [soft laughing] The second public service announcement, something that Redd Foxx actually tried to spread in America in the early 70’s. And I would say that most Muslims living in the West are all wondering why… nobody wash their ass. I’m just gonna say it. [laughs] [laughing]\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n It’s really weird. Please wash your ass. [laughs] It’s really weird that bidets are like not the norm, you know what I mean? Why is toilet paper the first and only option? It’s like, that’s it. It’s like leaves, toilet paper, baby wipes, and water. Why? Why would you do this? It’s obvio Everybody’s eating ass. Nobody’s washing their ass. It’s crazy. [loud laughing] It’s crazy. If you got shit on you, you’re like, “Oh, my God, I got shit.” You would wash it off right away. You’re like, “Oh, I’m okay now.” “I got the shit off of me.” But when you go, you’re like, “I’m fine.” And you just walk… [laughing] [huffs] My cousin came to visit me from back home. And he was like, “Hey, I want to try fivestar hotel.” I’m like, “Bro, of course. Enjoy yourself.” And he does it. And I said, “Hey, man, I’ll pick you up at noon at the mall. Next day.” He was like, “Okay.” And I picked him up the next day and I see him, he had this really upset look on his face. I’m like, “What’s going on, bro?” He was like this. I’m like, “What’s going on, bro?” He was like, “Allah Yoqrifhem”. “Allah Yoqrifhem”. I was like, “Bro, you can’t be yelling Allah in the middle of the Galleria Mall like this.” [laughing] “What are you doing?” “Relax.” “What’s the problem?” He goes, “They don’t have a bidet.” “They don’t have a bidet. Five star hotel!” “Not one star, two star, three star, four star, five star hotel! No bidet.” “Every time I go to the bathroom, I have to take a shower.” [laughing] “I’ve taken five showers today, Mo.” [laughing] “I’m more worried about your digestional tract, bro.” [laughing] “Five shits before noon. What are you doing?” [laughing] “Stop eating at IHOP, okay.” [laughing] My friend Nick came over. I upgraded all my toilets after my first Netflix special. Those Japanese toilets. And my friend Nick walks into the bathroom. He walks right back out. He’s like, “Hey, Mo, why does, uh, your toilet have a remote?” [laughing] I was like, “Oh, because it has a builtin bidet and blow dryer.” He was like, “What’s a bidet?” I was like, “You don’t know what a bidet is?” He was like, “No.” I was like, “Oh, my God, I failed you.” [laughing] I was like… I was like, “A bidet is once you go booboo, it sprays water up your around your ass and washes your ass.” His response to me was, “Ew.” I was like, “Ew?” I’m like, “Nick, you’re the ‘ew’ in this equation, bro.” Get in there and wash your ass.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n He was in there for like 20 minutes, man. He came out like he was baptized. He was like… He was like… [singsong] Ahahah!\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n He had a stride in his step. A new confidence I’ve never seen before. [laughing] Second public service announcement. The third one starts off with a question. Imagine it’s World War II era. Okay. Very important. Imagine it’s World War II era in America. And I’m walking around the States like, “Hey, would you like to try some of this sushi?” They’d be like, “Oh, what’s sushi?” You’d be like, “Sushi is a Japanese dish.” They’d be like, “Japanese!” “Get this damn Japfood out of my face!” [soft laughing] Probably what they would say. [soft laughing] Now imagine it’s September 12th, 2001, and I’m walking around the States like, “Hey, would you like to try some of this hummus?” They’d be like, “Oh, what’s hummus?” I’m like, “Oh, hummus is a very Arab dish.” They’d be like, “Arab!” [bash noise] “Get this damn sandniggaalQaidafood out of my face!” [laughing] It’s probably what they would say. [soft laughing] Here’s a very important clarification, the way you say it is “hummus”. It’s an “h”. It’s a “ha”. Okay. Jews, it’s not [Jewish accent] hummus. Okay. [Jewish accent] It’s not hummus. It’s not hummus. “Ghe” is a different letter in our alph',\n","  'abet. Okay. In our lang “Ghe” is a completely different letter. You don’t have the “ghe” in your language. So obviously it’s not yours. Back the fuck up. It’s our hummus.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Back up. It’s what it is. All right. And now hummus is everywhere. “Oh, I want some hummus.” Hummus, some shitty hummus everywhere. Fucking coffee shops have hummus. Seven Elevens have hummus. Every gas station, hummus, hummus, hummus. I was on a flight and the flight attendant comes up, “Would you like to have a little light snack?” I looked at it. I was like, “What the fuck is this?” She’s like, “This is hummus.” I was like, “No, it’s not.” This is a little juice box situation. You rip off a little corner and you get a little potato chip like this. And you squeeze it out. Just metaphorically shitting on my entire lineage. “Fuck your history.” That’s how it feels.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n That’s how it feels. “Fuck your grandmother with every shit of hummus that comes out of this thing. Ugh.” It’s not hummus. [soft laughing] I went to Trader Joe’s and they have those samples like, “Hey, would you like to try a some of this chocolate hummus? I was like, “What the fuck? It’s chocolate hummus.” [laughing] And then I just fainted like building seven. I just fainted. [soft laughing] We got to talk about it at some point. [laughing] Went to this South African fine dining South African restaurant when we were filming the movie in Atlanta. And the waiter comes over and he’s like, “Say, bra, we have some red bean hummus here.” I was like, “What the fuck did you just say?” He goes, “We have some red bean hummus here.” I was like, “Bro, are there chickpeas in this?” He goes, “Nah, bra, it’s red bean hummus.” I was like, “Bitch, hummus means chickpeas!” [laughing] This is refried beans, dog.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n Frijoles refritos homie. “You’re pawning off Mexican food now?” “As hummus? Get this shit out of my face!” Hummus is very simple. It’s four ingredients, sometimes five. That’s all it is. You get your chickpeas, tahini paste, lemon juice, salt, sometimes garlic. Okay. You get your food processor out. It’s like a little science experiment. Put it all in there, you’re like… [blending noise] “No, no, no. More tahini paste.” [blending noise] “No, no, no. More lemon juice.” [blending noise] You’re like, “Fuck, it’s all lemon juice.” More chickpeas. More tahini paste. “Fuck, it’s all tahini paste again.” “More lemon juice.” [blending noise] Like, “Fuck, it’s all lemon juice. Needs salt.” “Chickpeas and tahini paste.” [blending noise] You’re like, “Fuck, more tahini paste.” You’re like, “Oh, that’s perfect.”\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Now you have 20 pounds of hummus right here. [laughing] [huffs] [laughing] This is very important. You scoop out the hummus and you put it in a bowl. Okay. You put the hummus in a bowl! You don’t put it on a flat plate. Nobody know how to dip on a flat plate, bro. You got like race track marks everywhere. [laughing] You got hummus coming over the sides. Complete chaos. You need a bowl to help you with the scoop situation. Okay. Now we’re not done yet. You got that bowl of hummus and you make a little crater right in the middle. Grab some fresh chickpeas, you put it right in the middle for texture. Okay. And then you grab some olive oil. Not that clear yellow shit. Some deep green olive oil. “Oh, what do I do with that?” “Do I just drizzle, a little drizzle of garnish?” “No, whore. You turn it over… [laughing] …and you hold it. Okay.” “One Mississippi, two, three, four.” “If you think it’s too much, it’s not enough. Keep it going.” [laughing] Okay. I like to finish it off with a little lemon juice. And some diced up jalapenos. And I put them on each corner like that. Now if I serve you this extremely authentic Palestinian hummus and you grab a carrot, I’m gonna fuck you up, okay. [laughing] “I just want to try it and I’m watching my carbs.” “It’s not for you, ho. Back the fuck up!” [laughing] You need some fresh hot, fresh hot steamy pita bread. You rip off a little corner like this. And you put it together. And it just binds because it’s so steamy. You make a perfect cone and when you dip, you dip like this… You dip towards yourself. You don’t dip out! You’re like, “Oh, I wanna taste like what it’s like on that side.” “Bitch, it’s the same hummus on each side. Okay.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n “Nobody wants your stinky ass fingers in their hummus, all right.” “Oh, but I wanna taste what’s on that side.” “You know what, I’m gonna put a wall right in the middle of the hummus.”\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n “Put a wall right here.” All right. That side is hummus. This side is hummus. I was looking for a onebowl solution, but you won’t share, so BeTizik is what I’m saying.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Thank you so much, Houston. I love you. Thank you so much.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n [Mo] Man, I love you all. Take a seat, take a seat. What a beautiful thing. What a beautiful gathering. I take all of this very, very seriously. I’m gonna tell you why it’s all so important to me. It took me 20 years to get my citizenship. It’s talked about in my first special. I am Palestinian and it was the first time I was able to actually go back to Palestine. [whoops and cheers] Because you’re not allowed, you’re not allowed to go back, even though my mother’s born there, my greatgrandmother’s born there, my grandmother, my greatgrandmother… We have a thousand years of history there. Still cannot go there until you get your US passport. And it’s still an obstacle when you get there, you know. When you first get there, like, “Where you from?” “Bitch, where are you from?” [laughing] And she said, “Uzbekistan.” It’s tough. It’s a difficult thing. You always think about going home. Your mom talks about it. You see my family back home. And you want to go see it. Don’t ge',\n","  't me wrong, I’m saying “back home”, this is my home too. This is my house. My father is buried here.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n You understand?\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n [Mo sighs] So we went, for the first time I went to Burin, a little village short of Nablus, where my family is from. It was beautiful. I got to see my aunts. Amazing, cooking up feasts. This didn’t get here by no accident. [laughs] Some home cooking. You know. Sitting there with my aunts and I’m looking out over the landscape, thinking about my ancestors, thinking about my father, thinking about my history. I’m like, “Wow, I need to go to my grandparent’s house, who are no longer with us.” I was like, “I have to go to my grandparent’s house.” “I have to see where my mother was born.” “I have to see this, please take me over there.” So they take me over there. And I just sit and of course I had tears of joy and happiness. So much going on and we go to the rooftop. I’m like looking around. I’m like breathing in the air soaking it all up. I’m like, “Ah.” And I see these walls. These walls everywhere and it’s sad, but, you know. It is very sad and hopefully we can get past this at some fucking point. But I’m looking out into the village. I’m focused on the village. And I see this mosque in the middle of the village. And I look at my cousin, I was like, “How long has that mosque been there?” He’s like, “Hundreds of years. Like it’s been there for a hot minute, bro.” I was like, “I have to go pray there.” “I have to go pray there. I’m sure my father prayed there, my grandfather, my greatgrandfather. I have to go pray there.” He was like, “Let’s go.” So we go. And I prayed there. I was meditating. I was like, “Wow, what a beautiful thing, experiencing this. This is amazing.” And then these, like, five other guys were like, looked up at the clock and they were like, “Hey, man, it’s time for our Maghrib prayers.” I’m like, “What?” He was like, “Yeah, go do the call for prayer right now.” I’m like, “Bro, I’m not gonna do the call for prayer. I just got here, bro.” [laughing] They were like, “But you have the beard.” I’m like, “Not you too, bro.” “I’m just fat. I don’t want everybody to see the chin. You know what I’m saying?” Then he’s like, “No, you have to do the call for prayer.” “The time is now and you have to do the call for prayer.” I’m like, “Bra, I’m not gonna do the call for prayer.” And they’re like, “You have to do the call for prayer.” And they’re like, “You don’t know the call for prayer?” I was like, “Yeah, of course I know the call for prayer.” “But I had to go and speak into that microphone, a little tiny little microphone.” “For the whole village, bro?” “I performed in front of thousands of people, but this is a lot of stress, bro. Scared to make mistakes.” “There are religious implications to this situation.” And they’re like, “No, you have to do it.” I was like, “Okay, I’ll do it!” And I walk up and I was like, “Cousin, be next to me because I’m nervous. Make sure I don’t mess up.” [sighs] So I do the call for prayer. Throughout the whole entire village. And I’m overcome. I was like, “Oh, my God, this is amazing.” “What is this thing that’s been written for me?” “I can’t believe this happened.” Right as I’m thinking this a man just crashes right into the mosque. [crash noise] “Who did the call for prayer?” Like this. And everybody sells me out. “This guy. This guy did the call for prayer.” [laughing] “This guy did the call for prayer.” I was like, “Forget you all, man. You forced me to do the call for prayer!” He’s like, “Why did you do it?” I was like, “I just told you they forced me to do the call for prayer.” He goes, “Well, you just did it ten minutes early, bro.” “You did it ten minutes early.” I was like, “That clock is flashing, man. It’s saying it’s time.” He goes, “That clock is ten minutes ahead.” I was like, “I didn’t know that. That’s a digital clock. Push the little buttons and it will fix the whole thing. Okay.” [laughing] “You want me to do it?” And he goes, “Wait, wait, wait, wait.” “I’ve been in the village my entire life.” “I know everyone in the village.” “Who are you? I’ve never seen you before.” “Who was your father?” I tell him who my father is. He goes, “Oh, my God.” He goes, “Oh, my God.” “Your father is Mustafa?” I was like, “Yes, my father is Mustafa.” He goes, “You know who installed the sound system in this mosque?” “Your father did.”\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n It was truly one of the most beautiful things I have ever experienced in my life. And I had to tell you this story. Because just because I’m Palestinian and I’m forced to live where I am, it’s not what it is. Houston is the city that raised me. And now Netflix is the label that pays me.\\r\\n [loud cheering]\\r\\n I love y’all. Thank you so much, Houston, I love you guys.\\r\\n [cheering and applause] [cheering]\\r\\n [quirky flute music playing]\\r\\n On September 16, 2021, Mohammed Mo Amer would be recognized for his work which continues to inspire, encourage, and of course make people laugh, while providing particularly unique and valuable encouragement to Arab-Americans and other artists from underrepresented minority communities.

I had smoked a joint and I was watching a movie, Apocalypse Now. It was like just after 4:00 in the morning. And what later would become the known Northridge earthquake happened. It felt like it started in my apartment.\\r\\n You know? I’m from east of the Mississippi. On this side we don’t know what earthquakes are about. I got to tell you something, man [burps]\\r\\n Excuse me, burping.\\r\\n This shit was terrifying. It was absolutely terrifying.\\r\\n Uh, a lot of things went through my mind, I was like, not naked, but you know what I mean, just chilling in my boxers. Uh, I put my clothes on, I found my weed. And some, a pipe, and a lighter and some money, and my keys, all these things, while the earthquake is happening, while I’m experiencing what an earthquake is for the first time, and I was certain that I might very possibly die. As a matter of fact, I remember I made a point not to scream, just in case I lived, I wouldn’t have to remember myself being vocally terrified. But I forgave myself for being terrified. That earthquake couldn’t have been more than 35 seconds. This man kneeled on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds! Can you imagine that!? This kid thought he was going to die. He knew he was going to die. ',\n","  'He called for his mother. He called for his dead mother. I’ve only seen that once before in my life, my father, on his deathbed, called for his grandmother. When I watched that tape I understood this man knew he was going to die. People watched it, people filmed it, and for some reason, that I still don’t understand, all these fucking police had their hands in their pockets.\\r\\n Who. Are. You. Talking. To!\\r\\n What are you signifying? That you can kneel on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds and feel like you wouldn’t get the wrath of God. That’s what is happening right now.\\r\\n It’s not for a single cop, it’s for all of it. Fucking all of it. I don’t mean to get heavy, but.\\r\\n We gotta say something.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n He told the police he couldn’t breathe.\\r\\n One of the hardest parts of the tape to listen to.\\r\\n He said, “Please!”\\r\\n I can’t tell you, as a man, watching another man go through something like that, what it makes you feel like. I didn’t watch the tape for a week. I didn’t watch it. I knew. I saw a still picture, I said, I don’t want to see this, because I can’t unsee it. But when I finally watched it, I understood, nobody’s going home. Anyone who sees this, well they’re going to be furious.\\r\\n So the other night, I’m in my little clubhouse. And I’m watching Don Lemon, that hotbed of reality.\\r\\n He says, “Where are all these celebrities? Why aren’t you talking?”\\r\\n This n*gga said everybody. I was screaming at the TV: I DARE YOU SAY ME, N*GGA!\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I dare you!\\r\\n Has anyone ever listened to me do comedy?\\r\\n Have I not ever said anything about these things before?\\r\\n So, now, all the sudden, this n*gga expects me to step in front of the streets and talk over the work these people are doing? As a celebrity? Answer me, do you want to see a celebrity right now? Do we give a fuck what Ja Rule thinks? Does it matter about celebrity? No! This is the streets talking for themselves. They don’t need me right now!\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I kept my m',\n","  'outh shut.\\r\\n And I’ll still keep my mouth shut.\\r\\n But don’t think that my silence is complicit of all the shit these n*ggas are saying. Trying to get everyone to sing these fucking songs. I know all these songs.\\r\\n I was raised on these songs.\\r\\n Why would anyone care what their favorite comedian thinks after they saw a police officer kneel on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds? I can’t get that number out of my head because it was my time of birth on my birth certificate. I was born at 8:46 in the morning. And they killed this n*gga. And eight minutes and forty-six seconds.\\r\\n I watched everything everybody says. I see Candace Owens trying to convince white America, don’t worry about it, he’s a criminal anyway!\\r\\n I don’t give a fuck what this n*gga did. I don’t care what this n*gga did. I don’t care if he personally kicked Candace Owens in her stanky pussy. I don’t know if it stinks but I imagine it does.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And if I ever find out I’ll let you know for sure. I’ll tell like Azealia Banks, I’ll tell.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I’m the worst.\\r\\n But I know why. I figured out why they want to hear it from me, and it’s serious.\\r\\n The only reason people want to hear from people like me is because you trust me.\\r\\n You don’t expect me to think perfect. But I don’t lie to you. I’m just a guy. And I don’t lie to you. And every institution, every institution that we trust lies to us.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n How come they never talk about Chris Dorner?\\r\\n That’s a story about a man who believed he did everything right.\\r\\n Do you know who Chris Dorner is?\\r\\n Chris Dorner, if you remember, was an African American police officer in the LA PD.\\r\\n He was executing a warrant with his partner. Who was a white woman.\\r\\n And white women, I support you, but boy if you all don’t shut the fuck up.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n During the process of executing this warrant, this white woman did what Chris Dorner thought was excessive force. I don’t know what she did. She kicked the mother fuc',\n","  'ker that was handcuffed, or hit a guy that was handcuffed, or something. Chris Dorner, the Black police officer that watched this white woman do this, reported this to his superior. Made a formal complaint. And was subsequently fired from the LA PD.\\r\\n He went through the system.\\r\\n He took every legal avenue he believed he had to get reinstated.\\r\\n And he was not reinstated.\\r\\n And when his last appeal was finished, this motherfucker… some wild shit.\\r\\n Wrote a manifesto, you know where this is going.\\r\\n And in that manifesto, he called me a genius.\\r\\n Me. Dave Chappelle.\\r\\n Not just me, but me.\\r\\n He’s a Kevin Hart fan too.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n But he called me a genius. And he told Bradley Cooper who is a friend of mine, don’t do any more Hangovers, n*gga, that’s enough. That’s what he said.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And he told his story. Chris Dorner told his story, how he did everything right when he was in the military, and subsequently, this was before any of this shit happened, and then he said, which was the wildest thing, he said I’m going to wage asymmetrical war on the LA police department and their families. Well, that’s an ominous thing to say.\\r\\n And he did it.\\r\\n This motherfucker, ambushed two police officers who just sitting in their squad car. Murdered them. He went to another police officer’s house and killed his daughter.\\r\\n Boy, it was terrifying.\\r\\n And this motherfucker was on the run. He was doing it. I was supposed to do the GRAMMYs. I was supposed to present at the GRAMMYs that week, and a guy from the LA PD called me and said, “Mr. Chappelle we understand you’re coming to Los Angeles, and I don’t know if you know, but there is a lunatic on the streets who is killing police officers and we would like to know if we can pick you up at the airport? We are extending this courtesy to everyone he mentioned in his manifesto. And I told the police, I’m fine. I read the manifesto, he likes me.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Is there anything I can do for you, n*gga? Because I ge',\n","  't very worried!\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n They found him.\\r\\n Big Bear. He was hiding in a cabin. When they figured out where this n*gga was, no less than 400 police officers showed up and answered the call. And boy let me tell you something, they swiss-cheesed this n*gga. He is dead as dead could be. He is done.\\r\\n And you know why 400 cops showed up? Because one of their own was murdered.\\r\\n So how the fuck can’t they understand what’s going on in these streets?\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n We saw ourselves like you see yourself.\\r\\n They weren’t the only one.\\r\\n LeBron James once said something about racism and Laura Ingraham, which, I will say publicly anywhere, any time, is a cunt.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Tell ’em I said it.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Told one of Ohio’s greatest residents ever: “Shut up and dribble.”\\r\\n I’ll tell you something about LeBron.\\r\\n This n*gga was on the cover of Sports Illustrated when he was 17 years old, and exceeded every expectation that they had for him. This business is treacherous. This is a good guy LeBron, he’s a family man, and this, that and the other. He didn’t let anyone down. He didn’t let anyone down. Came back to Ohio, won us a championship, and then was like, I’m going to move to LA, and everyone in Ohio was like, n*gga we understand.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n He’s a good man, LaBron James. The bitch told my friend to shut up and dribble. My friend is the best at something, and this bitch is not the best at anything. Just a regular-ass white bitch with a platform. And I use the word bitch all the time because this is “black.”\\r\\n [sigh]\\r\\n Watch one shooting after another: Eric Garner in New York, the first guy that told the police, “I can’t breathe.” Eric Garner was selling loose cigarettes in Staten Island. When my kid was born, my first son, my wife lived in Staten Island, it’s an awful place. She knows it, everyone who’s ever been there knows it. Yuck, to Staten Island.\\r\\n And my black ass would go there, and I got a lot of fans there, and friends there, but this is ',\n","  'a very terrible place. Fuck everybody in Staten Island except the Wu Tang Clan.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Got murdered by one police officer while five of his fellow officers watched him do it.\\r\\n [no audio]\\r\\n Not one of them said, “Frank, Frank take it easy.” None of that shit. Because they were being recorded. Because they were afraid if I correct my fellow officer on this camera it’s going to open us up for some kind of liability. And the guy killed the person that they were, uh, what do you call it? Apprehending? The guy was selling loose cigarettes.\\r\\n There goes Eric Garner.\\r\\n [sigh] And then we have one after the other.\\r\\n Trayvon Martin gets murdered by just a regular n*gga that… George Zimmerman is nobody.\\r\\n George Zimmerman is an awful human being. He threatened Beyonce’s life, he threatened Jay-Z’s life, he signed Skittle bags because Trayvon Martin had Skittles on him when he was murdered by George Zimmerman. Boy, how do we feel?\\r\\n How do we feel right now? This kid was 15 years old being followed by a grown man with a gun and whooped his monkey ass. He beat the shit out of George Zimmerman and George Zimmerman murdered him, I’m very upset. This kid looked eerily like the president, he looked like my own children. I hate George Zimmerman. As an idea. Not as a guy, I’ve never met him. I’m sure I would though.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Hit the streets. You got them marching. Dylann Roof. Dylann Roof killed eight people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. He prayed with them first, and then he shot them at point-blank range.\\r\\n It goes on and on. And in one weekend a law abiding citizen right here in Beaver Creek is murdered. The cop that murdered John Crawford pulled me over the night before and let me off with a warning. And the next day, kills a kid. He says, drop the weapon, bang bang bang.\\r\\n This kid didn’t even have enough time to register that he was the one being spoken to.\\r\\n This is our home town. It happened right here. I was very proud to be your neig',\n","  'hbor, I love the way you guys hit those streets. We said his name and we tried to make sure everyone remembered him but he got lost in the sauce. And this guy John Crawford was a saint. He was there buying shit so him and his kids could make s’mores.\\r\\n Michael Brown got shot the same week, and Michael Brown became the story.\\r\\n And then, am I boring you?\\r\\n Well then, right back in Minneapolis was Philando Castile. Law abiding citizen, was a registered gun carrier, was trying to show police the paperwork for his registered weapon and was murdered in front of his wife and his child and then right in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, just two days later it happens again. And what do you think is going to happen? Three days later nine cops get murdered in Dallas at a Black Lives Matter rally.\\r\\n Wow, I’ll never forget it. It was the first time I ever thought, I gotta get my family the fuck out of this place. These n*ggas will never understand. I’m tired of explaining to these people something that’s so goddamn obvious.\\r\\n The guy that killed those nine cops, just like Chris Dorner before him, was from our military.\\r\\n And then right after he did it, another four cops were shot dead in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\\r\\n Again, a Black man, that served in our military. What are they doing? Why would our guys do that?\\r\\n Black people from the military? Because they believe, just like they did when they were joining the fucking military, that they were fighting acts of terror.\\r\\n These are our people. These are our countrymen.\\r\\n If I were white, and saw one of these men get murdered and I was in the NRA why wouldn’t I stand up for them. A card carrying legal gun owner that gets murdered in cold blood?\\r\\n Because he’s Black.\\r\\n That’s why they don’t give a fuck.\\r\\n There’s only one time the NRA ever supported an assault weapon ban.\\r\\n You know when it was? It was when the Black Panthers stormed the state capital with assault rifles in California.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Candace Owens, that rotten b',\n","  'itch.\\r\\n She’s the worst. I can’t think of a worse way to make money.\\r\\n The most articulate idiot I’ve ever seen in my fucking life. She’s so articulate she’ll tell you how fucking stupid she is precisely.\\r\\n And she told George Floyd’s wrap record…\\r\\n On the internet. “Oh, he was the this, he did that, and he was, he’s a drug addict. And he was not a hero. And why does the Black community make him a hero? Why do you chose him as a hero?” We didn’t chose him, you did! They killed him, and that wasn’t right, so he’s the guy.\\r\\n We’re not desperate for heroes in the Black community. Any n*gga that survives this nightmare is my goddamn hero.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n This is not funny at all.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I got some pussy jokes too, I could do, but I just really just…\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Slavery is a really wild concept.\\r\\n Uh, it’s some weird shit.\\r\\n The night that those nine police officers were killed felt like the end of the world.\\r\\n The only reason it wasn’t the end of the world, in my opinion, was because at the very same time that was happening, Kobe Bryant was playing his last game as an LA Laker. And as scary as all that shit was, I kept flipping back to see if Kobe would drop sixty, and he did. Oh, and he did.\\r\\n And vaguely in the back of my mind I remember the idiot ass bitch telling somebody to shut up and dribble, and I watched this n*gga dribbling and saving this goddamn country from itself. I loved Kobe Bryant. He died the night, the day I won a GRAMMY, he died.\\r\\n That’s why I didn’t show up at the GRAMMYs. Because Kobe died. They had both of his fucking jersey numbers hanging up. 8, 24. Well, that’s my birthday.\\r\\n I cried like a baby.\\r\\n [sighs]\\r\\n So, here’s what I said on Saturday Night Live that I got completely wrong:\\r\\n At the end of my set I talked about how few Black people were invited to the White House.\\r\\n How Frederick Douglass was the first. And that it didn’t happen again until Roosevelt.\\r\\n But that was wrong. It happened one other time before that.',\n","  ' Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson received delegation of African Americans at the White House. They were from South Carolina. There was a man who was lynched for a $30 dispute at a grain elevator and they killed him because the n*gga was rich, and they hated him for being more welathy then they were, and they murdered him. And the people in South Carolina said, fuck that, and they went via the governor of South Carolina, it was a Black delegation that was facilitated to meet with Woodrow Wilson. That delegation was lead by the AME Bishop William David Chappelle.\\r\\n That’s where I get my name. It was my great- grandfather, who was a slave when he was born.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n These things are not old. This is not a long time ago, it’s today. It’s today.\\r\\n That man’s wife was the woman that my father called on on his deathbed. And they were slaves.\\r\\n Are you out of your fucking mind if you can’t see that? And these n*ggas say why isn’t David Chappelle saying anything? Because David Chappelle understands what the fuck he is seeing. And these streets will speak for themselves weather I’m alive or dead.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I trust you guys.\\r\\n I love you guys.\\r\\n We’ll keep this space open.\\r\\n This is the last stronghold for civil discourse. After this shit it’s just rat-a-tat-tata-tat-ta-tat-tat-TAT!\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I love you very much, thank you for being here. Goodnight.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n ♫ Nobody Speak by DJ Shadow feat.

I got to tell you… let’s go.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n Thank you. I need you guys to know something. And I’m gonna tell you the truth, and don’t get freaked out. This is going to be my last special for a minute.\\r\\n [audience screams]\\r\\n It is all good. Listen to me. I did it in Detroit for that reason.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n That’s right. You wanna know why? ‘Cause I talked so much shit about Detroit in the first special I figured, I might as well, do the last special here. Sorry about that, by the way.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n First of all, before I even start, I’m gonna say that “I’m rich and famous.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n And the only reason I say that is ’cause the last 17 months were hell, and I cannot imagine what everybody went through. Well, I’m happy to see you and I’m happy you’re well and I hope everyone you love is okay.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n I don’t want you to worry about me, I’m… vaccinated, I… [audience laughs] got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I got to admit, that’s probably the most n*ggaish decision I’ve made in a long time.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I walk in to the doc like, “Give me the third best option.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I’ll have what the homeless people are having. So far, so good. And I know you probably heard on the news, I did get coronavirus. And it was something else. Like, okay first of all, when the doctor told me I had coronavirus I got to tell you, I was surprised how it made me feel. I felt dirty. [laughter] I felt gross. ‘Cause I’ve been walking around Texas just touching door knobs and shit, hands all moist. Tipping n*ggas with cash. “Here, take this to your family.” [laughter] I must have killed thousands of people. Just trying to get tonight’s show together so I hope you appreciate it ’cause a lot of n*ggas died for me to get this one off.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n I hadn’t felt that dirty in a long time. Last time I can remember, feeling dirty like that, man, I must have been a little boy. I was being molested by a preacher. [laughter] But don’t feel bad for me, I liked it. [laughter] I used to get a kick out of cumming in that fellows face.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n Well, he asked me to do it.\\r\\n They make you quarantine. I had to quarantine for ten days at least. They said “You’re gonna have to stay in the room,” I didn’t go nowhere. And it started making me nuts, ’cause I would just sit in the room and watch videos all day. Now, do you know what I was watching? And I hate to say this, but there was a lot of videos sadly, of Black people… beating up Asians for no reason. These attacks were unprovoked, I couldn’t believe it. And I was sitting in the room watching this shit, it would stress me out. I was stressed already because the whole time when you get coronavirus, at least the first five days you wait, and see how sick you’re gonna get. And it turns out, and this is true… I didn’t get sick at all. [laughter] Not a cough, not a booger, not a fever, nothing. Look at me I am the Magic Johnson of coronavirus.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n I just sat in the crib and got stronger all week. But I was stressed, ’cause I kept watching these videos of my beloved Black people beating up my beloved Asian people, and being so cruel. And the whole time I watched those videos, this is fucked up but I couldn’t help but feel like… When I saw these brothers beating these Asians up. It’s probably what’s happening inside of my body.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I didn’t get sick.\\r\\n I also saw a lot of videos of UFOs. I mean, what the fuck has been going on with that shit? This n*ggas are here. These UFOs keep coming to Earth and it made me think of an idea for a movie. Sounds dumb, but hear me out. In my movie idea we find out that these aliens are originally from Earth. That they are from an ancient civilization that achieved interstellar travel and left the Earth thousands of years ago. Some other planet that they go to and things go terrible for them in the other planet so they come back to Earth and decide that they want to claim the Earth for their very own. It is a pretty good plotline, huh?\\r\\n [audience] Yeah! I call it Space Jews. [laughter] Space Jews.\\r\\n [man] We loved it!\\r\\n Alright. It’s going to get worse than that, hang in there.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n It is going to get way worse than that. Then I thought of an idea for a children’s book. I actually wrote it. It is coming out soon. The book is designed to help parents, teach their children about racism which, if you’re a parent you know is an impossible concept to teach to a child. But I’m doing it. The book is about a big, strong beautiful Black man with a benign, regular-ass White name… and he has a White speaking voice. So whenever this motherfucker calls to get a reservation at a restaurant, oh, he gets the reservation. [laughter] That name and that voice, who could resist him? Now I should tell you, this Black man is literally an actual giant. And he is a strong dude. And when he shows up to them restaurants they see that big giant Black dude they say “You can’t come in here.” And they call the police. And then every installment of the book the police come, and they always shoot him.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n But remember, no, remember this guy is a giant, these bullets don’t kill him, they don’t even hurt him. They just break his heart. It is called Clifford, the Big Black N*gga, anyone?\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n This is my last special, because I have an objective tonight. I came here tonight… because this body of work, that I’ve done on Netflix I’m going to complete. All the questions you might have had about all these jokes I’d said in the last few years I hope to answer tonight. And I would like to start by addressing the LBGTQ community, correct.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n And I want every member of the community to know that I’ve come here tonight in peace. [laughter] And I hope to negotiate the release of DaBaby.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n Sad story! DaBaby was the number one streaming artist until about a couple of weeks ago. Took a nasty spill onstage, and said some… said some wild stuff about the LBGTQ community during a concert in Florida. Now you know, I go hard in the paint but even I saw that shit was like, “God damn, DaBaby.” He pushed the button, didn’t he? He pushed the button. Punched the LBGTQ community, right in the AIDS.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Can’t do that. Can’t do that. But I do believe and I’ll make this point later that the kid made a very egregious mistake. I will acknowledge that. But, you know a lot of the LBGTQ community doesn’t know DaBaby’s history, he’s a wild guy. He once shot a n*gga… and killed him, in Walmart. Oh, this is true, Google it. DaBa',\n","  'by shot and killed a n*gga in Walmart in North Carolina. Nothing bad happened to his career.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Do you see where I am going with this? In our country, you can shoot and kill a n*gga but you better not hurt a gay person’s feelings. [laughter] And this is precisely the disparity I wish to discuss. I have a question for the audience and this is a real question, I am not joking around. Is it possible, that a gay person can be racist? [audience] Yes! Yeah!\\r\\n Do you really think so?\\r\\n [audience] Yeah! Of course it is possible. Look at Mike Pence.\\r\\n [audience laughs] [applause]\\r\\n I am guessing, but I bet you, he is gay.\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n [woman] Oh my God.\\r\\n And he is not pride parade gay either, he is sad gay. I feel bad for him. He looks like one of them gays that prays about it. Jesus, please take these dirty feelings out of my heart. [laughter] Please Jesus, make these buttholes ugly to me. I don’t want to keep on tasting these dicks. [laughter] Funny. You guys are confusing your emotions. You think I hate gay people and what you’re really seeing is that I’m jealous of gay people. I’m jealous, I’m not the only Black person, that feels this way. We Blacks, we look at the gay community and we go “God damn it! Look how well that movement is going.”\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n “Look how well you are doing.”\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n And we’ve been trapped in this predicament for hundreds of years. How the fuck are you making that kind of progress? I can’t help but feel like if slaves had baby oil and booty shorts… [laughter] …we might have been free a hundred years sooner. You know what I mean? If Martin Luther King was like, “I want everybody to get up on them floats. Get your bodies good and shiny.” I don’t hate gay people at all, I respect the shit out of you. Well, not all of you. I am not that fond of these newer gays. Too sensitive, too brittle. Those aren’t the gays that I grew up with, I missed them old school gays, n*gga. Them Stonewall n*ggas, them the ones that I respect.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n They didn’t take shit from anybody, they fought for their freedom. I respect that shit, I’m not even gay and I want to be like a Stonewall n*gga. Them old school, gangster gays. Them glory hole n*ggas, them the ones I like.\\r\\n [woman cheers]\\r\\n These new gays don’t even know what the glory hole is. It’s a hole in the wall, that gay contractors build. [audience laughs] You want to know why they put that hole in the wall? I’ll tell you, there is no nice way to say it. ‘Cause when they want to have some fun they will put their penises in that hole and hope for the best. I respect that shit. It’s a lot of courage on both sides of that hole n*gga. [laughter] I’m not even gay and I want to try that glory hole out.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n What if Martin Luther King had to integrate the glory hole? “I don’t care if it is Black lips back there or White lips back there a mouth is a mouth. A warm wet mouth.” I’m going all the way. I got into a fight. I almost got into a fight, it is complicated. I was in a bar in Austin, with my wife and it was during Covid, and a woman came to our table and she was maskless, and this bitch came over, no mask, all “H” words. “Hi, how are you?”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Droplets was coming out of this bitch’s face. We all covered our drinks. Ew! Baby, what are you doing? Now I looked over the table that she came from, and I peeped game. The men at the table were filming me. This happens when you’re famous. People will come over and try to rattle your cage and get you to say something stupid or dumb so that their buddies can film it and get a video of you embarrassing yourself. And clearly I said, “This is what is happening.” And these dumb motherfuckers thought, it was my first rodeo.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Sadly it worked.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I ran right over there, I said… I pointed right in the camera I said, “You is a bitch-ass n*gga for doing this to me.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n And the dude was shocked that I said it. He said “Huh?” And when he did like this, I’ve seen all his fingernails is painted and I realized like, “Oh-oh.” [laughter] “This fellow is gay.” Yeah, you know how I talk. I call everybody a bitch-ass n*gga. You know what I mean? But that is not a right thing to do if they’re gay. You know what I mean? And now I was in trouble and not only that, the motherfucker was huge. He stood up, he was towering over me. He must have been 6′ 5″, a big White corn-fed Texas homosexual, this n*gga was ready to fight. And he started barking on me, but I stood my ground, I wasn’t scared. How could I be scared? This motherfucker’s shirt was tied up in a knot like this. Oh, fuck this guy. Let’s go, n*gga, let’s go. I thought we were going to come to blows. I was ready and then right when you think we would fight, guess what he did? He picked up his phone and he called the police. And this, this thing I am describing is a major issue that I have with that community. Gay people are minorities, until they need to be White again.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’m being very brutally honest, so we can solve this problem. I’m telling you right now a Black gay person would have never done that to me. ‘Cause a Black gay person knows, when the police shows up they’re not going to care who called ’em. They don’t show up like, “Which one of you n*ggers is Clifford?” [laughter] We’re all Clifford. This happens far too often. Another time, about six years ago, there was a lesbian woman that tried to sell a story about me to TMZ. Thank goodness, TMZ could see right through the sham of that story. This woman claimed that I beat her up in a night club because she was a lesbian. That is fuckin’ crazy. Bitch, I didn’t even know you was a woman.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n Thank God! TMZ didn’t believe that because I did beat the shit out of her, I am not gonna lie.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n It was her fault, I had no choice. I came into the club minding my own business and a woman came up to me, and she goes “Oh my God, Dave Chappelle.” And I was just being reciprocally nice. “Hey, miss, how are you?” Blah, blah, blah. Benign talk, nothing to it. And all of a sudden this lesbian fellow stepped between us. “Hey n*gga, that’s my girl!” I said, “Yo, my man, back up.” Like that. She said, “I ain’t backing up off shit, n*gga, that’s my girl!” I said, “Bro, you gonna have to give me three feet, like this.” She said, “Stop calling me a man, motherfucker.”\\r\\n I am a woman.”\\r\\n I said, “What?” [laughter] And then I looked deep in this n*gga’s cheek bones. And I said, “Oh my God, you are a woman.” This is too much for me to even wrap my mind around but I tell you what, I un-balled my fist immediately and I softened my posture so that she would know, she is in no danger. I even changed the tone of my voice. I said softly, sweetly, like a pimp might say. [laughter] “Bitch, I’m ’bout to slap the shit out of you.”\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n I should have done it. Oh, I wish I didn’t say that. She dropped that foot back, she was in a perfect southpaw stance. Her shoulders were angled correctly, her head movement was good, I said “Oh, no! this bitch boxes for real.” She threw a wild hook at me and I saw it coming from yesterday, so I slipped it like this… I had no choice, I had to go to work. I let that jab go, you should have seen me go n*gga. I tenderized them titties like chicken cutlets. [laughter] I whooped the toxic masculinity out of that bitch.\\r\\n [man cheers]\\r\\n That is why I don’t go out no more. Just trying to chill, I’m just trying to live a peaceful life. That’s why I live in Ohio, you know, I live in a little town in Ohio. Must be like 3700 people, small hippie town. Culturally you might feel like, like Ann Arbor to you. [laughter] You know what I mean?',\n","  ' Bunch of hippies and shit like that. And n*ggas always ask me like, “Dave, why do you live in that hippie town?” And I’d be embarrassed to tell ’em the truth. Well, you know why I live there? Because Yellow Springs, Ohio has the most beautiful women in the world. And a lot of people might disagree with me but, you got to see them for yourself, they’re gorgeous. But it all depends on what you’re into. You know what I mean? I like White bitches with dirty feet.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n If I had a strip club in Yellow Springs, I would have called that shit “Strippies.” All naked hippies, all the time. And I would only hire girls with long titties and long vagina head that looks like they slept on it. And I would keep a pile of dirt, right next to the stage. I’d come up like, “Bitch get your feet in that dirt and get up there and give those people what they came to see.” “Chalk up, bitch.” Couple of years ago I was in Ohio, at a shopping mall. An old White lady… This is true, she was following me around the mall. Which sounds paranoid, but I’m sure she was following me. Mean lady too. You ever see a woman with lines on her face? That just tell you like… even if she’s smiling, it would look like it would hurt the muscles in her face. I knew she was following me, ’cause she was at places that had nothing to do with her I’d be looking around like, “What is this old bitch doing in Gamestop and Footlocker and all the places I like to go?” Every time I see her, she’d just be looking mean on me. And eventually I forgot about it. So, then after, I am shopping I go all the way to the back of the parking lot, I’m parked all the way in the back and as soon as I open my car door I hear a voice go, “David Chappelle.” Just like that. I didn’t even have to look, I knew it was her. And I looked back and sure enough there she was, that face. To be honest with you, she probably wasn’t even that old. She’s probably around my age. But she was a White woman, this bitch looked terrible. [laughter] I’m going all the way. I kept my cool, I was nice. I said, “Hello, miss.” And she didn’t say anything back, all she said was “I watch your comedy.” I said “Oh-oh.” And then she says, this is true, she goes, “Sounds to me… like you, hate women.” I said, “Well, you know what, miss? It’s art.” You are free to interpret this art however you like but I can tell you as the maker of this art that I don’t believe that I feel that way. And she said, “Well, I think…” And I said, “Shut up, bitch! Shut the fuck up!”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n “Before I kill you and put you in the trunk. Ain’t nobody around here.”\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n I’m just kidding, I didn’t say that. I felt that way, but that’s not what I said. I was more clever than that. You know what I said? And this is exactly what I said, I said, “Miss, before you finish that statement, let me ask you a question. Where did you see me? Did you buy a ticket to a concert I did, I doubt that. Or, maybe you watched one of my specials on Netflix. Or… Or… Did I follow you to your car and do my act?” She said, “What?” I said, “Keep it in the comments section, bitch, this is real life, ta-ta.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n And then I drove off. And now I got to tell you and this is gonna surprise some people here, but not everybody. People say things to me all the time but what you don’t know, is it does affect me. I think about it. And that one bothered me a lot, I was driving home, couldn’t stop thinking about what this woman said because she is not the first woman that said that to me. It’s puzzling. You know what I mean? Like, what could I possibly be saying… that would make these bitches think, I hate women. [laughter] Couldn’t figure it out. So, you know what I did? I Googled the dictionary definition of a feminist just to make sure, I was talking about the right thing. And do you know, sir, what the dictionary definition of a feminist is? I didn’t either, listen to this. Webster’s defines a feminist as a human being, not a woman, a human being, that believes in equal rights for women. I was shocked, ’cause that is what that meant ’cause by that definition I would consider myself a feminist, and I didn’t even know that at the time.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n All these years, I thought it meant frumpy dyke.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n Well, that seems always talking to be some… chick in overalls, “Men are trying to rape us.” “Ah, not you bitch, will you please…”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I know, look, listen, I support the feminist movement, I do in my own ways. Well, you guys did the women’s march, I tried to go and support you and none of my friends would go with me. I asked all the fellows, none of them wanted to go. I tried everything. “Come on y’all, there’s gonna be bitches there.” They was like, “Nope.” [laughter] So what I did is, I called my friend Anj. Anj is a Black woman who is a comedy writer and she’s dope. A matter of fact, a matter of fact, she’s the only woman, that I know personally that pays her ex-husband alimony. And she sounds just like a man when she does it. “Fuck that broke motherfucker” and all that, she says all that shit.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n So I hit Anj up, I hit her on the text and all I did, I texted. I said, “Anj, are you going to the women’s march?” And she texted me back, and this is a real text, she said… she said, “I hope those White bitches get tear gassed.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n There is a problem in that feminist movement, isn’t there? From its inception in America there has always been a racial component. When Susan B. Anthony was having that meeting and Sojourner Truth’s Black ass showed up. Read your history books. All the White women asked Sojourner Truth not to speak. They didn’t conflate the issues of women’s rights and slavery. But you know how Black bitches are, so Sojourner Truth went up there anyway.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause and cheering]\\r\\n She did a famous speech, she said “Ain’t I a woman?” “Ain’t I a woman?” That’s right. And listen, listen, listen. I supported the “Me Too” movement, but the whole time, the whole time I thought that the way they handled it was stupid. [laughter] It was, it was White, it was like… they were doing shit, like going to the Golden Globes and all of them would be like “Let’s all go to the Golden Globes and wear black dresses. And give these men a piece of our minds.” Bitch, that is not gonna work. You think Martin Luther King is gonna be like, “I want everybody to keep riding the bus, but wear matching outfits.” [laughter] You got to get off the bus and walk. It’s real talk. A real talk, that was a silly movement. “I want everybody to wear crochet pussy hats so they know we are serious.” What the fuck was y’all doing? And then I said something about it in one of my specials and all these women actresses came after me. I said, “Man, fuck y’all too, you canceled. I ain’t jerking off to none of your pictures again.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n They were like, “Who is he to tell us anything?” I’ll tell you exactly who I am. I’m the one that got off the bus and left $50 million on the bus and walked.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n I agreed with these women. I just didn’t agree with what they were doing about it. Right. Right. No, it was annoying as fuck… because if these women were serious, you know what they would have done? They all would have fired their agents. And they would have went to the mailroom of one of these big agencies and found a woman that was bustin’ her hump in there and said, “If you want to talk to us then you have to talk to her.” And if they did that, then she would be big, and they would be big and nobody would get fed to Harvey Weinstein. But did they do that?\\r\\n [audience] No!\\r\\n No.\\r\\n Was that their idea? No. Surprisingly it was mine. What I think, the feminist moveme',\n","  'nt needs to be very successful… is a male leader.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I’ll do it. I will. I will lead you women to the promised land. I will make sure you will get equal pay for equal work. I will make sure that nobody harasses you or fucks with you on the job. I will protect all of your interests. And all that I ask for in return… is that you suck my dick.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n And now, we’re right back to square one, aren’t we? And now we get to the core of the crisis. What… what is a woman? What is that, in this day and time? Is there even such a thing as a woman or a man or anything? Hmm. Hmm? Seems to be a question nowadays. Now listen, women get mad at me gay people get mad at me, lesbians get mad at me, but I’m gonna tell you right now, and this is true… these transgenders… the n*ggas want me dead.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I’ve gone too far, I’ve said too much. But I got to tell you, I’m very worried about it. I’m not even joking with you. Every time I come out onstage, I be scared. I be lookin’ around the crowd, searching. For knuckles and Adam’s apples to see where the threats might be coming from. A n*gga came up to me on the street the other day. He said, “Careful, Dave, they after you.” I said, “What?” “One they, or many theys?”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Before I even say anything about that community you must know and I hope you all feel the same way I am not indifferent to the suffering of someone else. There’s laws, the mean laws in our country. North Carolina passed a law once. They said a person in North Carolina must use the restroom that corresponds with the gender they were assigned on their birth certificate. No, no, no, no. No, that is not a good law. That is a mean law. No American should have to present a birth certificate to take a shit at Walmart, in Greensboro, North Carolina where DaBaby shot and killed a motherfucker.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n You have to ask yourself, if you’re thinking about it, who are these laws designed to protect? Like let’s say they designed this law to protect me, my interests, transphobic comedian, Dave Chappelle. Let’s say I’m in Walmart, doing a little shopping with my family. Now I should tell you if that ever happens in real life, you should know my dreams didn’t work out.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Well let’s say something goes horribly wrong and there I’m in Walmart with the poor Whites rummaging around for mediocre goods and services.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n And then I got to go to the restroom. So, I excuse myself from my family. I go to the men’s room. Now I’m standing at the urinal, taking a leak. And this is what this law is gonna do. And suddenly a woman walks into the men’s room. I’m like, that’s strange. And then she stands shoulder to shoulder with me at the urinal, I’m gonna be like, “Bitch, what’s going on with you?”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And then she hikes her skirt up and she pulls a real live, meaty dick out!\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n What do you think I am going to say? Thank God, she’s in here with me. At least now I know my family is safe. Mm-mm. No, I’m not gonna feel that way at all, I’m gonna feel very uncomfortable. I would feel better if it was a man with a vagina that backed up to the urinal next to me. [audience laughs] I wouldn’t even think about that, I’d just be like, “That’s funny.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n “This guy is peeing out of his butt for some reason.” “Oh my God, he must be a Veteran, thank you for your service.” I’m not indifferent to people’s suffering ’cause I know it’s hard to be everybody. We Blacks, we just got our first big holiday in a long time. Happy belated Juneteenth to the Blacks.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Juneteenth is a strange holiday, isn’t it?\\r\\n [audience] Yes.\\r\\n It commemorates when Black people in Texarkana area of the country first found out that they were free. But remember, they were free when they found out. They just didn’t know it yet. Very interesting holiday. You know, I learned something This is a wild story. I learned this past Juneteenth of a story, this is true. And it’s that there was a Black man who was in South Carolina during slavery who somehow got granted his freedom by his so-called master. And when his master granted him the freedom he also gave him a plot of land. Now it turns out, this brother was brilliant. He had a good eye, good knack for farming. And he farmed this plot of land very successfully and made a lot of money, and this is where the story gets crazy. When he got all that money… this n*gga brought some slaves.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Have you ever heard this before? This is a true story. Not only was he a slave owner, he became a slave breeder. And employed tactics that were so cruel even White slave owners were like, “Yo, my man.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n He was a wild dude, but he did it just because that’s what successful people did at the time. He just wanted to be down, what a fuckin’ tragedy. How can a person that went through slavery perpetuate the same evil on a person that looks just like him. It’s mind blowing. And shockingly, they’re making a movie about him. Ironically… it is called Space Jews.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [cheers]\\r\\n Space Jews. [distant chuckling] The point of that story is this person was invested in a construct. That was the construct of successful people and he just followed the roadmap of successful people. He followed what they called “an incentive.” Now, everyone struggles but I’m very invested in the gender construct, personally. ‘Cause I’m a man with kids, and a wife, and I like that warm, wet soft pussy that my wife has.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n This does not mean that I feel like another point of view can’t exist. I was doing a night club in Oakland, 16 years ago and this was the first time that the trans community ever got mad at me that I knew about. And then I was nobody, I had just quit Chappelle Show. It was like a nothing hole in the wall club and I was doing some transgender jokes in Oakland, it was 16 years ago. My pronoun game was not as nice as it is today. I went too far, I said things like tranny and shit I didn’t know these words were bad, and a woman stood up and just gave me the business. Started screaming at me, and I’m sure it was a woman. But she kept calling me transphobic and all this shit I had never even heard these words before, it was really weird. I didn’t trip, I just gazed at Security to look like, “Go on, get that bitch out of here.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I kept it moving. And then she went to the press. The next day one of the gay papers wrote all of the same things she had said to me, about me in the paper. Misquoted the jokes, and was calling me transphobic you know, these words, I had never heard them before but every time that I talked with anybody from the community since they always repeat the talking points from that article. My least favorite of which being, I hate this phrase they say, “I was punching down on them.” “Punching down”, what the fuck does that mean? Now fast forward. It is 2019. And I am in a restaurant in Ohio, very nice restaurant. It’s Thanksgiving week. And to be honest, it is not a very nice restaurant, but it is a nice restaurant, if you’re a White person from Ohio that has never been anywhere before. [laughter] Picture Chili’s.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I’m sitting in the bar, I’m having a drink by myself and the only other person in the bar is a woman, a couple of stools down. And she was alone, and she was older, and that made me feel sad, ’cause it was the holidays. So, I told the bartender, “Send that woman a drink on me.” Just trying to spread the cheer, and I wish I didn’t. This woman wanted to talk. She wasn’t mean, she was nice, but she just wanted to talk about shit that you know, I mean a n*gga just trying to get drunk don’t want to hear about this bitch remodeling in her bathroom. An',\n","  'd I’m sitting there, trying to be polite. Oh, subway tiles? Word. But then she hits a lick. Piqued my interest. She says, “My daughter is coming home for the holidays.” Like, “Oh, that is great news, I’m glad you’re not going to be alone.” And then she goes on and on about how great her daughter is. I guess her daughter got a new agent and she is out in Hollywood, she’s in movies and on television and all this stuff and as she’s telling me this, I’m thinking, this woman is so sweet. She probably doesn’t even know who I am. Or what I do for a living because I know what your daughter’s is out in Hollywood doing.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And then she goes, “Would you like to see her picture?” “Oh now I don’t want to see this woman’s picture, but what am I gonna do?” I’m like, “Okay sure, I’d love to see the picture.” And I grab the picture and this is all I say, this is all I say, “Oh… she is very beautiful.” And as she puts the picture away she… looks mean all of a sudden, like she caught me in some kind of trap. “What did that face mean?” And then she goes, “She’s transgender.” And I think to myself, “Oh, this bitch does know who I am.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I really resented that trap because that trap doesn’t let me be honest. If I was honest, I wouldn’t have fallen for it. I’d have just looked at the picture like, “Look at that big chiseled jawline, that big thick Joe Rogan neck. Is that a dude? Is your daughter a man?” Can’t say that shit. It’s really annoying. Fast forward, now it’s a couple of days later. It’s the Wednesday… before the Thursday that’s Thanksgiving, and I’m in a totally different bar and this bar, trust me, is not a nice place. It’s foul, it’s one of those bars where the top shelf should be under the sink. [laughter] This is where the poor Whites drink. The Tiki torch Whites. You know what I mean? Them White people, they believe in “Q” and they love Trump. You know what I mean? Like Michigan White people.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I remember I was at this bar one time, it was that kind of bar it is. I was in there one time, I was fucked up and I turned around to everybody in the bar and go “Hey everybody, I am going to buy everyone in the bar a round of drinks.” And all the motherfuckers was like, “Hurrah!” And the bartender knew I was drunk, so she pulled me aside. “Mr. Chappelle, are you sure about that?” That’s going to be 16 dollars.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Tough time for the Whites. And this was a holiday weekend. You know what I mean? These motherfuckers were having a rootin’ tootin’ time. They was in there partying, making all them noises. “Ooh! Ow! Yeow!” You know all them noises White people make before lynching? They was doing all that shit. [audience laughs] I was drunk. I looked over my shoulder, I thought I was trippin’. Guess who was in the bar? I thought I was seeing things, I looked across the room and I saw… the trans-bitch from the picture. [laughter] I couldn’t believe it. I said “What is a trans person, doing in a place like this? This is very dangerous behavior.” And she was with, two big, buff, gay Black dudes. I didn’t know these dudes, but I know they was gay. If they had a dick in their mouth, they wouldn’t look any gayer than they did just sitting there. [laughter] They had 1980s gay face. You know what that is? Remember in the ’80s when gay people looked surprised all the time.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n “Close your mouth, n*gga, what is surprising”, you know what I mean? But they was huge, they looked like Jussie Smollett’s trainers.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And I am thinking, “Man these motherfuckers are in a lot of trouble.” So what I do is I stand up and everybody in the bar likes me, so I make a big show of it to make sure that everyone can hear me. Now, I walk right up to her, and I go “Hey! I just met your mother the other night and she told me all the great things you’re doing in Hollywood. And I cannot believe that someone from a podunk place like this can achieve all that, I’m so proud of you. Welcome home.” And the whole bar said “Hurrah!” And I said “Phew.” “That ought to buy her some time.” You know what I mean? A couple of more drinks and these fellows are gonna start asking her for some pussy, she might not have.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And she was very gracious. She said “Thank you so much”, and we shook hands and as she was shaking my hand, her face turned mean, like her mom’s. And she said, “Do you mind, not punching down on my people?” Oh, I don’t like that. Normally, I would’ve let it go, but I was drunk.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I said, “What might you mean, bitch?”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I was careful to call her a bitch, ’cause I didn’t want to blow her cover. [audience laughs] Turns out she wasn’t hiding. She was loud, she was proud. She let me have it in front of everybody. Screaming at me, all the talking points from that article. You transphobic, this and that. Kept clapping her hands in my face. “Let me tell you somethin’.” I said, “Where did you learn this from, Black bitches?” She kept going, “Let me tell you something, honey.” So annoying. She kept calling transgenders, her people. Ain’t that weird? “My people this, my people that.” I said, “What do you mean, your people?” Were you all kidnapped in Transylvanian, brought here as slaves? [laughter] She said, “My people have struggled for decades, honey, decades.” And I looked at them gay Black dudes, like. “Is there anything you n*ggas need to tell this bitch? [laughter] Clifford, Clifford?”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I am exaggerating, she is actually a very nice person and I’m cool with her now, but boy, that shit got on my nerves. And it got on my nerves because, whenever someone says that to me I know they have never seen me for themselves, they just repeat what they’ve heard. Any of you, who have ever watched me know that I’ve never had a problem with transgender people. If you listen to what I’m saying, clearly my problem has always been with White people.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’ve been arguing with the Whites my entire career. Just when I thought I had you guys on the ropes you changed all the rules. “Oh yeah?” – Yeah, motherfucker! – “Well.” I am a girl now, n*gger. You must treat me as such.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n “Call me a girl, n*gger.” It’s annoying as fuck. No, no, go back, go back tonight after the show, watch every special I did on Netflix. Listen to everything I’ve ever said about that community. I’ll go through ’em. I said, “How much do I have to participate in your self image?” I said, “You shouldn’t discuss this in front of Black people.” I said, “I know n*ggas in Brooklyn that wear high heels just to feel safe.” I asked you “Why is it easier for Bruce Jenner to change his gender than it is for Cassius Clay to change his name?”\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n If you listen to what I’m saying, I’m not even talking about them, I’m talking about us and “they don’t listen.” It’s very annoying. And they have canceled people, more powerful than me. They canceled J.K. Rowling, my God. J.K. Rowling wrote all the Harry Potter books by herself. She sold so many books, the Bible worries about her.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And they canceled it because, she said in an interview and this is not exactly what she said, but effectually she said that gender was a fact. And then the trans community got mad as shit, they started calling her a TERF. I didn’t even know, what the fuck that was. But I know that trans people make up words to win arguments. [laughter] So I looked it up. TERF is an acronym. It stands for Trans-exclusionary radical feminist. This is a real thing, this is a group of women… that hate transgender. They don’t hate transgender women but they look at trans women the way we Blacks might look at Black face. It',\n","  ' offends them like, “Oh, this bitch is doing an impression of me.” [laughter] Now I shouldn’t speak on this because I’m not a woman nor am I a trans. But as we’ve established… I am a feminist. [laughter] That’s right.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’m team TERF. I agree. I agree, man. Gender is a fact. You have to look at it from a woman’s perspective. Look at it like this, Caitlyn Jenner whom I have met, wonderful person. Caitlyn Jenner… was voted, woman of the year. Her first year as a woman. Ain’t that something? Beat every bitch in Detroit. She’s better than all of you. [laughter] Never even had a period, ain’t that something? [laughter] I’d be mad as shit if I was a woman. I’d be mad if I was me. If I was in the BET awards, sitting there and they’re like “And the winner for n*gger of the year… Eminem.” My man. [audience laughs] Gender is a fact, this is a fact. Every human being in this room, every human being on Earth had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on Earth. That is a fact. [laughter] Now… I am not saying that to say, that trans women aren’t women. I’m just sayin, that those pussies that they got… You know what I mean?\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’m not saying it is not pussy, but that’s like Beyond Pussy or Impossible Pussy. You know what I mean? It tastes like pussy but that’s not quite what it is, is it? It’s not blood, that is beet juice. [laughter] Oh buddy, I’m in trouble now.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n Before I go, I want to share this story with you because it is important to this point. I want your community to know that one of the coolest people I ever met was a transgender woman. And this is not a man that I knew that became a woman, this woman was trans when I met her. Lived in San Francisco, Daphne Dwarman is the name. I would do 18 shows in the Bay Area sometimes in Oakland and Dirty Hood night club and she would be there, white trans woman, laughing loud and hard, at everything I said. Especially the trans jokes, very puzzling… because she was obviously trans. And one night after one of the shows I met her. And what it was, turns out it was her dream to be a comedian. And I was her hero. It was very moving. I could not dislike somebody that felt that way about me. We became fast friends. And when I made that special Sticks and Stones right as it was coming out, I happened to be in San Francisco and I wanted to do a show. But I needed an opening act, and I remembered… that trans woman I had met, so I called her on the phone. And I called her myself, I said, “Hey Daphne, this is Dave Chappelle.” She couldn’t believe it. And I go, “I’m in San Francisco.” And then she started saying a bunch of wild stuff, I was like “Relax now, I don’t want any pussy, I was… [laughter] I’m just calling, because I’m doing a show and I need an opening act. And I was wondering if you’d open the show?” And she was like, “Fuck, yeah.” Now… I didn’t know this at the time but this woman had only done stand up comedy eight times in her life. This was little to no experience and now she’s about to open a show for what many call the GOAT.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n She’s an amateur in stature, but in practice, she was very professional. She showed up early, which is something I appreciate ’cause I like people to be on time. She was dressed to the motherfuckin’ nines, I mean, I’m transphobic and even I was like, “You look nice.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Went up on the stage with all the swag of a professional comedian, grabbed that mic and walked right down the middle and looked at the crowd like a gangster. Man, you should have seen her work. This bitch bombed for 45 minutes, straight.\\r\\n [cheers]\\r\\n And I’m not exaggerating, young man. That show was terrible. Stunk. Stunk. And then she brings me on, and you know, I was like a glass of water after a handful of salt. The crowd was happy to see me. I was killing it. But here is what impressed me. Any other comedian I’ve ever seen, if they had bombed as bad as she did, would have snuck out of the back of the theatre and went home and cried or something, but she didn’t do that. Not only did she not leave, she found a seat, right up in front. You know, when a new comedian watches an experienced comedian in comedy we call this “taking class.” And this bitch took my whole class, she sat up there and was laughing as hard as she always laughs as if nothing bad had even happened to her. And I saw her show. Something bad happened to her.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n She was drunk. So she starts talking to me, while I’m onstage but the way a person would talk to a television when they were alone. She was talking to me like that. That didn’t bother me ’cause I knew her. But the crowd didn’t like that shit at all ’cause she sucked. And a guy in the back of the room stood up and Daphne’s hair was dyed blonde at the time and the guy screamed out, and his energy felt wild as fuck. He said, “Hey Daphne!” and everybody got clamped, they got tense. We didn’t know who was a heckler or active shooter, and… [laughter] …he said, “Does the carpet match the drapes?” It was fucked up. The whole crowd kind of groaned, ’cause it was so like, mean. Everybody groaned, except for Daphne. She kind of laughed, which was weird. And she didn’t even look all the way back. She said, “Sir, I don’t have carpets I have hardwood floors.” Just like that. [laughter] Just like that.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Boy, when she said that shit, it blew the roof of the place. Cut through all the tension, with that one joke. She had made up for 45 minutes of a stinker of a show. And after that, she could do no wrong. And I kept on rocking, and she kept on talking to me. And then the show became something cooler than a show. It became like a conversation between a Black man and a White trans woman and we started getting to the bottom of shit. All of them questions that you think about that you’d be afraid to ask, I was just asking them and she was answering them and her answers were funny as shit. The crowd was falling out of their chairs and at the end of the show, I go, “Well, Daphne”… I said “Well, that was fun.” I go, “I love you to death, but I have no fuckin’ idea what you’re talking about.” The whole crow laughed except for Daphne. Man, she looks at me like I’m not her friend anymore. Like I’m something bigger than me, like I’m the whole world in a guy. Then she said, “I don’t need you to understand me.” I said, “What?” She said, “I just need you to believe…” Just like that she goes, “…that I’m having a human experience.” And when she said it the whole crowd kind of gasped. And I gave the Fight Club look. I said, “I believe you, bitch.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Because she didn’t say anything about pronouns. She didn’t say anything about me being in trouble. She said, “Just believe I’m a person and I’m going through it.” I know I believe you, because it takes one to know one.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Then I told the crowd “Good night.” And they started going crazy and before the applause gets to it’s crescendo I was saying, “Don’t forget my opening act, Daphne.” And the crowd stood up. And I looked at her, tears came out of her eyes she couldn’t believe it was happening. I couldn’t believe it was happening ’cause her show stunk. [laughter] And it was a great night. And I remember, the late great Paul Mooney was there bunch of flyers, comedy n*ggas was there.\\r\\n [cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n And we all went backstage and was just drinking and talking shit and laughing and Daphne stole the room, she had everyone cracking up. Spinning the yarn, telling us all these crazy stories about shit, she’d be into. We all laughing real hard, and there she is telling us and everyone is laughing. I’m looking around, I’m like, “Oh my God, she is funny.” I pulled her aside, I said, “You’re hila',\n","  'rious. I didn’t know that when you were onstage.” [laughter] I said, “You’re doing some things wrong but I can help you.” I said, “Anytime I’m in San Francisco why don’t you open the show for me and I’ll just try to give you some pointers and see if you can work this thing out.” She said, “Are you serious?” I was like, “Yeah.” And she grabbed me real tight, hugged me, squeezed me. And I pushed her off violently, ’cause I’m transphobic. I said “Boundaries, bitch!”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n When Sticks and Stones came out… a lot of people in the trans community were furious with me and apparently they dragged me on Twitter. I don’t give a fuck, ’cause Twitter is not a real place.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n And the hardest thing for a person to do is go against their tribe if they disagree with their tribe, but Daphne did that for me. She wrote a tweet that was very beautiful and what she said was and it is almost exactly what she said. She said, “Punching down on someone, requires you to think less of them and I know him, and he doesn’t. He doesn’t punch up, he doesn’t punch down he punches lines, and he is a master at his craft.” That’s what she said.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n Beautiful tweet, beautiful friend, it took a lot of heart to defend me like that, and when she did that the trans community dragged that bitch all over Twitter. For days, they was going in on her, and she was holding her own ’cause she’s funny. But six days after that wonderful night I described to you my friend Daphne killed herself. Oh yeah, this is a true story, my heart was broken. Yeah, it wasn’t the jokes. I don’t know if was them dragging or I don’t know what was going on in her life but I bet dragging her didn’t help. I was very angry at them, I was very angry at her. I felt like Daphne lied to me. She always said, she identified as a woman. And then one day she goes up to the roof of her building and jumps off and kills herself. Clearly… only a man would do some gangster shit like that. Hear me out. As hard as it is to hear a joke like that I’m telling you right now, Daphne would have loved that joke. That is why she was my friend.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n I was reading her obituary and I found out, she was survived by a daughter. And the moment I found that out, and this is true Anderson Cooper from CNN texted me. And all he says, it’s very nice, he said, “I’m sorry to hear about your friend.” And I texted him right back. “New phone, who this?” [laughter] He said, “It’s Anderson Cooper.” Oh, I said, “Anderson, look I need to find her family.” And he texted me right back with all the phone numbers and all this information. I say this to say, if you ever want to know about anything gay call Anderson Cooper from CNN. This n*gga is faster than Google. [laughter] What I did is, I got in touch with her family and I started a trust fund for her daughter ’cause I know that is all she ever really cared about.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n And I don’t know what the trans community did for her but I don’t care, because I feel like she wasn’t their tribe, she was mine. She was a comedian in her soul.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n The daughter is very young, but I hope to be alive when she turns 21 ’cause I’m going to give her this money myself. And by then, by then, I’ll be ready to have the conversation that I’m not ready to have today. But I’ll tell that little girl, “Young lady, I knew your father… [audience laughs] …and he was a wonderful woman.”\\r\\n [cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Empathy is not gay. Empathy is not Black. Empathy is bi-sexual. It must go both ways. It must go both ways.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Remember, taking a man’s livelihood is akin to killing him. I’m begging you, please do not abort DaBaby.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Kevin Hart dreamt his entire life of hosting the Oscars and when he finally got the job they just took it! It’s not fair. They didn’t kill him, Kevin is a strong guy. But I’m sure it broke old Clifford’s heart. It’s over. LBGTQ, L-M-N-O-P-Q-Y-Z, it is over. I’m not telling another joke about you until we are both sure, that we are laughing together. I’m telling you this is done. I’m done talking about it. All I ask from your community, with all humility will you please stop punching down on my people?

Seeing the quotes even with context- this shit is transphobic, plain and simple\\r\\n Did you get to the part at the end where he’s defending a trans comedian and pointing out how much of a great human being she was? Watch the special.\\r\\n You dont stop racism by being racist.  You do it by being the best human being you can be, so when any race sees you, they see the best of who we all are.  When every thousand people like you become become like i just described, the way you described them goes away into the background and those one thousand do not think what color they are when they are on stage, like you do when you are with this kind of material.  I know you hurt, but making money telling your audience how racist you are against other racists is admitting you are not willing to stand on your own, but just preaching to the crowd.  Everybody is clapping cause you are putting down people who are putting down people. You cannot build people up by putting down those you are putting down.   None of your script shows you have material to make your world better for your audience. Tell me what good does that do?  You are just agrreing with your black audience that white racists are no different than you are; just trading colors. Show your audience you are better than white or black racists. “Red and yellow, black or  whit, they are precious in His sight. Jesus  loves all the children of the world!”  Prove this is so by loving them all unconditionally.  just as you would like to be loved.  Give us humor so we do not think skin color at all.  And if you are funny or not, we won’t.\\r\\n w\\r\\n Couldn’t disagree with you both more. Dave Chappelle is smarter than the average Bear.\\r\\n No one is saying he isn’t smart. If he was just dumb I’m not',\n","  ' sure many people would care. Smart people still do bad things and latch on to harmful ideologies. His being smart enought to make his argument appealing is part of the problem. It is clear here that with few exeptions this set is designed to otherize, demonize, discredit and slander the LGBTQIA+ Commmunities. He designed it to exclusively, claim for himself the mantle of victim and erase any intersectionality that doesn’t support his argument.\\r\\n Agree. What doesn’t translate is the joke delivery and the sarcasm.  Brings so many hard subjects to light and makes the audience FEEL it, even if it’s uncomfortable. I’ve hated the way he uses certain words, but the delivery is spot on.  I appreciate that he’s willing to have real discussions.\\r\\n Seeing the comments, it seems to me that trans activism (as opposed to a trans person) is dishonest, stupid, and nasty. I had a lot of sympathy for the LGB community when they fought for their rights because their arguments made sense and their cause was just. I thought I felt the same way about the transgender cause when they fought for the right to be who they wanted to be, but then it was no longer about them or about protecting people but about persecuting people, making stuff up in order to persecute people, and ignoring facts when the facts are not convenient. \\r\\n Arguably, Dave Chappelle offended White people, Black people, Asians, Women, Jews, Texans, and many others in his special, but it is significant that only the Trans community took serious offense – not because his words endangered them or denied them their rights but because his narrative was different to their narrative – and that it was not enough to allow them to be who they wanted to be, he had to also stick to their talking points or he would be deemed offensive.\\r\\n The central premise of many minority causes is that there are many different perspectives, e.g. being Black or Latino or Asian is just as valid as being White; being Gay or Lesbian or Bi is just as valid as being Heterosexual. But Trans activism seems to have taken two paths – one path advocates the validity of being Trans, whereas the other goes beyond self-identity to insist on policing the meaning of words and the perspective of others (in short, rejecting the diversity of views and opposing views). It is not a good idea to use the One Ring to create your ideal society. There are different views on gender (Dave Chappelle also makes this argument), and if the Trans-radicals insist that there is only one correct view, then they are not much different from the Church groups and others who also insist that there is only one correct view of gender, and then it simply comes down to power politics to determine who gets their way.\\r\\n If the “opposing view” is saying to a trans woman “you are not a woman” or a trans man “you are not a man”  then yeah that’s some Karl Popper emergency level we are one step away from genocide level intolerance that cannot be tolerated. Just look the fuck around at how hatred of trans people is the salking horse for all manner of societal opression. Did you read HB@ in NC? there is all kinds of hateful shit in that bill that doesn’t have anything to do with Trans. And let’s not pretend for one second we don’t know who Chapelle’s tired tirade benefits most. White.male.patriarchy.\\r\\n With context, Chappelle is clearly an ally. He specifies not only that trans women are women, he APOLOGIZES about using the T slur. He obviously does more in the show to clarify his viewpoints, but to me, these are the key points of interest. A transphobe would never apologize for using to T slur. In fact, they’d use it a lot on purpose. He is an ally to the LGBT community. We cannot allow people to ruin someone’s career over poorly paraphrased words.\\r\\n no one is ruining his career…this comment is laughable. Exactly how is he an ally?\\r\\n This man is up front and caring. He’s the little boy in the emperor has no clothes story.\\r\\n Personally  I think Mr.. Chappell  is more vulgar than amusing but there are those that enjoy his type of humor. As a fellow human he is entitled to his views and as long as there is an audience willing to pay to hear those views nobody has the right to try and cancel his career.\\r\\n Applause-break comedy is the fucking worst. It might as well have been the Late Show with Steven Colbert\\r\\n Have you ever been to a stand up show where the comedian didn’t pause for applause? You’re delusional.\\r\\n Without the delivery, this reads as surprisingly insecure.\\r\\n That was actually worse than I thought it would be. And I was expecting it to be pretty bad, after seeing his first comeback special, which had poor material, and poor delivery. He keeps trying to act like he’s ignorant when he was raised by two damn professors. It’s pretty clear the audience he’s trying to appeal to – reactionaries. 16 years ago, he left his own show because he decided to draw a line. People like me supported his decision, even though that sudden decision made it hard for everybody else working on that show. Now he’s trying to do his comeback, appealing to these reactionaries, he’s claiming nobody else is allowed to draw a line. His new audience laps it up, and doesn’t question him for a moment. It feeds his ego, and his bank account. Doesn’t achieve anything else. Not deep enough to be philosophy, not funny enough to be comedy, it’s just a middle-aged cis guy ranting about how hard he’s finding it to progress. I could walk into most bars and get the same for free.\\r\\n Chappelle makes it clear that he needs Dorman to exist on his terms, not hers — not as a trans woman with autonomy, but as a trans woman who’s proven she deserves autonomy by way of having a chill, laid-back sense of humor. Furthermore, in repeatedly reducing Dorman’s existence to her body parts and her relationship to them and the language surrounding them, Chappelle dehumanizes her and dehumanizes other trans people.\\r\\n Dorman’s fate — she died by suicide shortly after the release of Sticks and Stones in 2019 — directly undermines Chappelle’s logic. Because Dorman was trans, she was at an extremely high risk of dying by suicide or transphobic violence. Any way you look at it, trans people are among the most vulnerable populations in society:\\r\\n Out of all hate crimes that result in homicide that target LGBTQ and HIV-affected people, 72 percent of the victims are trans women, according to 2013 data.\\r\\n 50 percent of trans people will experience sexual assault or abuse in their lifetimes; this number is even higher for Black trans people.\\r\\n 54 percent of trans people experience intimate partner violence.\\r\\n Trans people of color are six times more likely to experience police brutality than white cisgender people.\\r\\n 10 percent of trans people experience violence from a family member after coming out as trans. Eight percent of trans people are kicked out of their homes after coming out.\\r\\n 30 percent of trans people experience homelessness at least once in their lives.\\r\\n In 2015, 30 percent of trans people reported experiencing workplace harassment, including sexual assault, physical harassment, or being fired for their gender expression.\\r\\n More than 50 percent of trans teens seriously considered suicide in the last year; more than 66 percent of trans teens experienced major symptoms of depression within the two weeks prior to the survey.\\r\\n This is what Chappelle’s critics mean when they discuss the real-world impact of Chappelle’s transphobia. His comedy, which involves continually insisting, against science, that gender is always tied to biology, isn’t just reactionary semantics. It’s dangerous rhetoric that’s been shown in study after study can directly impact the levels of anti-trans violence and societal prejudice that trans ',\n","  'people already face daily.\\r\\n It’s important not to omit this reality from the equation — which is what Chappelle does when he treats Dorman as though she’s a comedian first and a trans woman second.\\r\\n Chappelle seems to think all trans people should have the attitude of comedians like Dorman\\r\\n Chappelle views comedians as their own “tribe.” In The Closer, he even claims Dorman for his own “tribe” and not for the trans community: “She wasn’t their tribe, she was mine,” he says. “She was a comedian in her soul.”\\r\\n Chappelle’s not just talking about comedy as a medium here, he’s talking about comedy as a worldview. Comedy is a subculture, after all, with its own very particular set of rules and mores. Perhaps the chief rule is the one comedians tend to embrace the hardest: Always, always be able to take a joke.\\r\\n In the past, this principle has led to the privileging, within the comedy community, of the comedian’s right to make rude, disturbing, or even heinously offensive jokes. The logic goes that if the comedian can take a joke, the audience should be less sensitive, too. (See, for instance, the notorious moment in 2012 when a comedian heckled a woman in the audience who reacted to a sketch about rape jokes by making a rape joke about her.) Much of the recent cultural conversation over comedy and free speech has centered on the idea that comedians should be able to discomfit their audiences, whether in the service of making them laugh or making them think, without backlash — and that if you can’t handle a joke that makes you uncomfortable, that’s your problem, not the joke-maker’s.\\r\\n Dorman herself was adept at taking an offensive joke. As Chappelle recalls, when an audience member interrupted one of Dorman’s shows with a transphobic question, she shot back by making an even better joke about her own anatomy. This, Chappelle wants us all to know, should be the response when we’re confronted with transphobia: not anger, hurt, or pain; not a walkout in protest of Netflix, but good-humored deflection.\\r\\n This rule applies, at best, within the realm of comedy, between a comedian and their audience, not to the lived experiences of people in their everyday lives. Chappelle seems to need all trans people to accept the mores of his own very specific professional subculture, and he makes this request sound reasonable — he’s just a guy wanting to be allowed to make transphobic jokes without getting canceled for it, geez — but in practice, it’s baffling. Most people aren’t comedians, and most people are sensitive to jokes designed specifically to hurt them. Chappelle’s idea that trans people should have to prove, like Dorman, that they can take a joke without getting offended before they’re worthy of respect is a bit like a journalist demanding trans people prove they can use AP style before allowing them to command a conversation about their own gender identity.\\r\\n What’s more, if “always be able to take a joke” is sacrosanct, there’s another rule that comedy holds just as dear: the one about never “punching down.” In comedy, punching down refers to humor that targets vulnerable groups of people who don’t hold much power in society. It exists in opposition to the kind of “punch up” that aims to critique people and institutions with power. Onstage, punching down is generally considered a huge “No” — the kind of thing that can immediately alienate an audience if you’re not doing it to make a deeper point. (Chappelle talks about this concept in The Closer, asking the larger LGBTQIA community not to “punch down” on his people, using Kevin Hart and DaBaby as examples.)\\r\\n Chappelle’s deeper point seems to return again and again to the idea that trans people are too sensitive and that this sensitivity is somehow bolstered by white fragility. He seems to feel that his prioritization of the pain of Black communities over those of trans communities — as if, again, they are entirely separate — justifies an evening devoted to homophobic and transphobic jokes. Because Chappelle seems to believe that all queer and trans people have white privilege, he views himself as punching neither up nor down and even quotes Dorman as suggesting as much.\\r\\n But Chappelle, of all people, should know better. He’s hyper-aware, as a comedian who frequently uses humor to make points about racial and social justice, that comedy impacts the real world. In fact, in 2005, Chappelle completely killed his own hit comedy show, the legendary Chappelle’s Show, because of one joke that made him realize, according to an interview he gave to Time, that rather than critiquing racist comedy, he might instead be reinforcing racist stereotypes for white audiences who were enjoying the joke unironically.\\r\\n At the very least, then, Chappelle should know that there’s a possibility his jokes about trans people could be taken the wrong way and used to hurt trans people. There’s even an echo of the 2005 moment in the new special, when Chappelle has to stop and gently reprimand an audience member who starts to applaud a transphobic law. As Vulture’s Craig Jenkins put it, “You talk enough shit, and you’ll draw flies.”\\r\\n Rather than acknowledging this possibility and its potential for harm, Chappelle not only justifies his comedy using white privilege, but seems to go a step further: He suggests that being hurt is good for trans and nonbinary people. When he says, “As hard as it is to hear a joke like that,” and then follows it up with any kind of defense, he’s telling audiences that he knows the joke is painful, hurtful, and transphobic — but that it’s somehow productive for trans people to be confronted by it. That it’s a learning experience to be confronted with transphobia onstage, as though trans people aren’t confronted with gender policing in every other moment of their lives.\\r\\n Only then, in Chappelle’s telling, can Chappelle and trans people “[start] getting to the bottom of shit.” Once trans people have shown him that they’re capable of being good-humored about other people’s continual objectification and degrading dismissal of transgender identity issues, they can — on the terms of the person using transphobia to interact with them — be heard and accepted and loved.\\r\\n This isn’t equality. Chappelle, who’s spent his entire comedy career using humor to make sharp, trenchant commentary on racism and injustice, should know that. Trans people should never have to just live with or get over or get used to rhetoric that dehumanizes them. The man who speaks viscerally about the fear Black Americans experience daily should know that asking trans people to accept and embrace transphobic ideology isn’t tolerance. It certainly isn’t the love and good humor he wants to be credited with.\\r\\n And despite the audience laughing with Chappelle, it’s not funny at all.\\r\\n Correction, October 25, 12:15 pm: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that trans women comprise 72 percent of all hate crime homicides. It has been corrected to state that trans women comprise 72 percent of hate crime homicides targeting LGBTQ and HIV-affected persons.\\r\\n Jenny, a very well-constructed essay!  You make quite a merited case from some very good points to think about, especially the paralleling of racism with transphobia.\\r\\n “Chappelle makes it clear that he needs Dorman to exist on his terms, not hers ”\\r\\n How can you possibly say that when you didn’t even know her? \\r\\n  “Furthermore, in repeatedly reducing Dorman’s existence to her body parts and her relationship to them and the language surrounding them, Chappelle dehumanizes her and dehumanizes other trans people.”\\r\\n Dave reduced Dorman to her body parts by talking about who she was as a person? \\r\\n “In comedy, punching down refers to humor that targets vulnerable groups',\n","  ' of people who don’t hold much power in society. ”\\r\\n Please stop, don’t give me this pseudo-binary between those who vulnerable and those in power. When intersectionality has taught us, anything is that identity is not black and white. Are you saying a gay trans white woman who is upper middle class is more vulnerable than a cis straight white man who’s a coal miner? LGBTQ community isn’t a monolith where everyone is equally as vulnerable or marginalized. And no, that’s not oppression Olympics that is just facts. \\r\\n  “Because Chappelle seems to believe that all queer and trans people have white privilege, he views himself as punching neither up nor down and even quotes Dorman as suggesting as much.”\\r\\n No, he seems to believe his punching up as many LGBTQ don’t seem to be aware of their white privilege among their own communities.\\r\\n “This, Chappelle wants us all to know, should be the response when we’re confronted with transphobia: not anger, hurt, or pain; not a walkout in protest of Netflix, but good-humored deflection.”\\r\\n Er, did you miss the part where Dave literally mentioned the time when Dorman reacted in hurt and pain as opposed to good nature deflection? v\\r\\n Like I’m something bigger than me, like I’m the whole world in a guy. Then she said, “I don’t need you to understand me.” I said, “What?” She said, “I just need you to believe…” Just like that she goes, “…that I’m having a human experience.” And when she said it the whole crowd kind of gasped. And I gave the Fight Club look. I said, “I believe you, bitch.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Because she didn’t say anything about pronouns. She didn’t say anything about me being in trouble. She said, “Just believe I’m a person and I’m going through it.” I know I believe you, because it takes one to know one.\\r\\n “There’s even an echo of the 2005 moment in the new special, when Chappelle has to stop and gently reprimand an audience member who starts to applaud a transphobic law.”\\r\\n Gently reprimand? He flat out calls it a “MEAN LAW” you seem to be downplaying this fact because you know it would undermine your entire argument. \\r\\n “Chappelle not only justifies his comedy using white privilege, but seems to go a step further:”\\r\\n Okay, you lost all credibility when you claim that Chappelle is using white privilege with his comedy.\\r\\n “His comedy, which involves continually insisting, against science, that gender is always tied to biology, isn’t just reactionary semantics. It’s dangerous rhetoric that’s been shown in study after study can directly impact the levels of anti-trans violence and societal prejudice that trans people already face daily.”\\r\\n Citation needed. You have shown no causal link between believing gender is a biological reality (at least to a certain extent) to violence against the trans community.\\r\\n Cis people: “Chapelle isn’t transphobic! Nothing he said was transphobic!!”\\r\\n Chapelle: “Look at that big chiseled jawline, that big thick Joe Rogan neck. Is that a dude? Is your daughter a man?”\\r\\n Chapelle absolutely is transphobic.\\r\\n “Chapelle: “Look at that big chiseled jawline, that big thick Joe Rogan neck. Is that a dude? Is your daughter a man?”\\r\\n Chapelle absolutely is transphobic.”\\r\\n Wow, the transcript is literally right there but you still choose to cherry pick. v\\r\\n “And then she goes, “Would you like to see her picture?” “Oh now I don’t want to see this woman’s picture, but what am I gonna do?” I’m like, “Okay sure, I’d love to see the picture.” And I grab the picture and this is all I say, this is all I say, “Oh… she is very beautiful.” And as she puts the picture away she… looks mean all of a sudden, like she caught me in some kind of trap. “What did that face mean?” And then she goes, “She’s transgender.” And I think to myself, “Oh, this bitch does know who I am.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I really resented that trap because that trap doesn’t let me be honest. If I was honest, I wouldn’t have fallen for it. I’d have just looked at the picture like, “Look at that big chiseled jawline, that big thick Joe Rogan neck. Is that a dude? Is your daughter a man?” Can’t say that shit. ”\\r\\n He was literally juxtaposing saying a trans daughter is beautiful to saying something offensive to very same woman. He was basically saying ” what exactly did she want me to say, would she rather I out her daughter as trans or be polite and say she’s beautiful like any person would regardless of if they are trans or not”.\\r\\n Oh, for fuck’s sake.\\r\\n At one point, the “boundaries, bitch!” part, he ACTUALLY SAYS “I’m transphobic”.\\r\\n You can take that seriously or not, that’s your prerogative.\\r\\n But, this is an act, and if you take any of this seriously, you’re missing the point.\\r\\n Almost no one cares about the fact that he calls women bitches constantly. I’ve never understood this. \\r\\n Also, can everyone here stop using the term “cisgender” as an all-encompassing opposite to “transgender”? You mention things like the fact that trans people are more likely to suffer police violence than cis people. You should not use the term “cis” here because you don’t know the gender identity of every single person who interacts with or is abused by police. Just because someone doesn’t openly identify as trans doesn’t mean they are cis. Cisgender is a dangerous word that is thrown around far too much.  Stop using it unless you know for sure.\\r\\n Dave Chappelle is right and not only is he right his not the first to make this point about LGBTQ community. To prove it let me compare Dave quote with an article I found. \\r\\n He picked up his phone and he called the police. And this, this thing I am describing is a major issue that I have with that community. Gay people are minorities, until they need to be White again.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’m being very brutally honest, so we can solve this problem. I’m telling you right now a Black gay person would have never done that to me. ‘Cause a Black gay person knows, when the police shows up they’re not going to care who called ’em. They don’t show up like, “Which one of you n*ggers is Clifford?” [laughter] We’re all Clifford. ”\\r\\n Now let’s compare Dave sentiment for this passage in an op-ed piece about white privilege within the LGBTQ from NBC news. v\\r\\n “Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our “safe spaces.” In 2017 during Philly Pride, for example, the attempt was made to add a black and brown stripe to the rainbow flag. This action was met with anger from white gay men who felt the flag represented unity despite skin color — a particularly tone-deaf defense given that Philadelphia’s gay bars had recently become a hotbed for racism.”\\r\\n Which leads me to Dave asking the audience v\\r\\n  “Is it possible, that a gay person can be racist? ”\\r\\n I think this proves that the answer is YES. v\\r\\n “It isn’t a coincidence that in that same summer of 2017, 11 owners of queer spaces in Philadelphia went through mandatory anti-discrimination training after several incidents at various gay bars — including the discovery of a YouTube video showing bar owner Darryl DePiano using racial slurs in 2016, and other alleged incidents involving racial discrimination.”\\r\\n Your email address will not be published.

I think the biggest reason is I have a hearing loss that I’ve had since I was really young. When I was three-years-old my… I failed the hearing test.\\r\\n “And my doctor was like: You need hearing aids!”\\r\\n “And I said: No.”\\r\\n “And he said: Oh, okay.”\\r\\n “He just like let me do it.”\\r\\n I’m three.

I can’t hear now.”\\r\\n “I don’t know what the fuck people are saying I didn’t wear them until I was twenty-one.”\\r\\n “Mos… Two thirds of my life was just guessing.”\\r\\n “I didn’t know what people were saying.”\\r\\n “People would say shit and look at me.”\\r\\n I’m like, Ah!

After that, they move on.\\r\\n They’re like, “We’re gonna hang out ',\n","  'with this dude who can hear.”\\r\\n And I don’t say that for pity, either.\\r\\n I don’t want anyone to feel bad for me ’cause I know I wouldn’t do differently if I was in their situation.\\r\\n I’m not better than anyone. I know that.\\r\\n I’ve been on the other side of that.\\r\\n My grandma’s eighty-four years old rapidly losing her hearing.\\r\\n Cannot hear shit. This is my grandma.\\r\\n Like, I love her!\\r\\n But every time I say something to her she’s like…\\r\\n My first thought is just die, already!\\r\\n Like, that’s my first thought.\\r\\n And I don’t want anything bad to happen to my grandma but I also don’t wanna have to say what I just said again.\\r\\n Like, I just said it! You had your chance.\\r\\n Somethin’s gotta give here.\\r\\n It might as well be the person who can only eat sweet potatoes.\\r\\n She had eighty-three good years. I didn’t have that.\\r\\n My point is I can empathize with my oppressors.\\r\\n It’s a weird disability. Like it’s weird.\\r\\n Like, even the things that are made to help you, people are kinda like…\\r\\n Like, they’re… about like it’s just…\\r\\n Like, I watch movies with closed captioning on which is how I watch ’em.\\r\\n I’ve always watched ’em that way. I never used to tell anyone about it I never used to bring it up because I didn’t wanna be different.\\r\\n I didn’t wanna be seen as different.\\r\\n I didn’t wanna call attention to the fact that I was different.\\r\\n The first time I brought it up I was in college.\\r\\n My roommate was like “Hey, you wanna watch a movie?”\\r\\n I was like, “Yeah. Do you mind if we turn on the closed captioning?”\\r\\n “I got, like, a hearing thing” figuring he’s my friend he’d understand.\\r\\n And he said…\\r\\n And here’s the thing it’s not the same.\\r\\n If it was the same I would just ask for that.\\r\\n Second of all, I’m not even sure you’re legally allowed to say no.\\r\\n Like, this is what they’re for motherfucker.\\r\\n Turn ’em on. Like, I’m the guy.\\r\\n Like, what do you think there for? To fuck with you?\\r\\n For the people at the gym?\\r\\n Like, I’m the person that the technology is for.\\r\\n Turn them o… Like there’s a picture on the back of the box of a… Like the ear. Closed captioning.\\r\\n That’s my fucking ear!\\r\\n Turn ’em on, you psycho.\\r\\n It’s like in no other disability is this even remotely acceptable.\\r\\n It’s like, if your friend was in a wheelchair and he was like “Hey, do you mind if we take the ramp?”\\r\\n Would you be like… “Come on! The ramp?”\\r\\n “It’s all the way on the other side of the building, dude.”\\r\\n “The normal door is right here.”\\r\\n “It’s three steps. Can’t you crawl up there?”\\r\\n “Aren’t your arms stronger?”\\r\\n “Can’t we just pick you up and throw you?”\\r\\n “Is that fine? You still get there.”\\r\\n “It’s the same!” It’s not the same.\\r\\n Turn on the closed captioning man.\\r\\n I wanna see when acoustic music is playing.\\r\\n I gotta know. That’s how you know what’s goin’ on in the movies.\\r\\n You see that parentheses like, Up-tempo techno and you go, Oh! Okay.\\r\\n Now I see what’s goin’ on in this David Lynch film.\\r\\n I was … I was so lost before.\\r\\n But you didn’t look like you were about to jump in the shower.\\r\\n “Oh, that’s very nice…”\\r\\n Take it off.\\r\\n I would just think a lot, so I would just think, I would think… I would just think all day\\r\\n Just thoughts.\\r\\n It’s comfortable, because you I never would mishear myself.\\r\\n Like I never have a thought and I’m like, “Wait, one more time?”\\r\\n It’s just there. I know the thought.\\r\\n There’s a comfort to that. It gets intense, though because after a while like, the thoughts get weird.\\r\\n It’s weird up here it’s just not… A lot of weird…\\r\\n A lot of fucked up thoughts. Fucked up.\\r\\n And the thing is, you don’t know your thoughts are fucked up until you say them out loud and then that look of horror overcomes people and you’re like… Like you don’t know your thought is fucked up until you say, like, “Hey if we could eat animals why can’t we fuck them?” And people are like, “What?”\\r\\n And you’re like “Oh… I don’t know. I was just thinking about me and I feel like I… I’d rather get fucked than eaten.”\\r\\n Like I think if you told an animal, like… “Hey, we’re about to murder and then eat you”\\r\\n They’d be like … “Can you please just fuck me?”\\r\\n I would think about suicide a lot.\\r\\n Not… I didn’t wanna do it I just thought, like… If I did it',\n","  ' what would a funny way be?\\r\\n Like, what would a funny way be? I don’t wanna go out boring.\\r\\n Like, what would be a funny end to all of this?\\r\\n I think it would be funny if you go to a water park and you go to the top of a really… like, a tall waterslide and, like right as you’re about to go down you just blow your head off and make the corpse go, like… through the whole course of the slide like, all the tunnels and the turns and just… just like splashes in the bottom of the pool.\\r\\n All the kids are screaming, parents are like, sprinting towards the pool.\\r\\n You know, funny!\\r\\n I think you would think that was funny even if you were there even if you were at the water park even if that was your kid in the pool.\\r\\n Once you got the kid outta the pool you dried him off you put him in the car on the ride home you’d be like…\\r\\n That’s a pretty good bit. Like, I think you would recognize the level of commitment alone is impressive like, “Oh my God! He brought a gun to a water park?”\\r\\n “He waited in line up the steps for like twenty minutes?”\\r\\n “He had goggles on, why the fuck did he have goggles on?”\\r\\n Who cares if you get water in your eyes if your… brain is exploded?\\r\\n “I’m gonna miss that guy.” You start missing me.\\r\\n You feel that kinship through the attention to detail.\\r\\n Fucked up thought.\\r\\n And that’s just a thought that I had.\\r\\n I’m not tryin’ to make light of something that people, you know ’cause it’s it… Suicide is a tough subject.\\r\\n There’s some subjects people think are just never funny.\\r\\n And I hear that I’m not like a sociopath I’m not like “Everything is funny! Fuck you!”\\r\\n No, it’s like you know I think about it I don’t wanna hurt anybody.\\r\\n But suicide’s a tough one it’s a tough one because people get offended at suicide jokes but it’s never suicidal people.\\r\\n It’s always like suicide-adjacent people.\\r\\n Like, suicidal people… Love suicide jokes.\\r\\n Right? You know why? Cause… That’s their thing.\\r\\n Like everybody has a thing.\\r\\n Like, if you’re married maybe you like a joke about marriage.\\r\\n ‘Cause you hear it, you’re like “Oh honey, that’s so us or whatever.”\\r\\n Suicidal person hears a suicide joke, it’s the same thing.\\r\\n It’s like “I’m not gonna tell anyone but that is so me!”\\r\\n You’re gonna find out in a note how good that joke really was and then regret not laughing more later because it is on the money.\\r\\n It’s cathartic.\\r\\n Like, if you’re dealing with those private, painful personal dark thoughts to hear them talked about and made light of in a public forum that’s a cathathat’s catharsis.\\r\\n You feel connected to someone outside your own mind.\\r\\n That’s a positive emotion.\\r\\n I’m not gonna take that away from someone just to spare someone else a moment of discomfort.\\r\\n But I get why people get upset.\\r\\n I had a dude once, he was like “That’s not funny.”\\r\\n “You should never joke about that.”\\r\\n “My nephew killed himself. You think that’s funny?”\\r\\n I was like “What? No.” I was like, “What? No.”\\r\\n “No, that’s not what I’m talking about at all.”\\r\\n “That’s not funny.”\\r\\n “That’s incredibly sad.”\\r\\n “I’m sad right now hearing about it, you know ’cause your nephew…”\\r\\n “Would’ve loved that joke.”\\r\\n It’s like, yeah, my target market is missing, tragic.\\r\\n Also, if he would’ve heard this joke he wouldn’t have felt alone as he obviously did and that’s really my point is if you don’t like something just let it go and hit the people that it’s meant for.\\r\\n That’s not for everybody.\\r\\n There are people who are gonna hate it. There’s people right now who are like “Dude, I fucking hate this joke and it’s gone on way too long and I just want it to end.”\\r\\n And it’s like… All right\\r\\n and now you know how suicidal people feel about life.\\r\\n We want them to stick it out a little bit longer.\\r\\n I think you can, too.\\r\\n The joke was about empathy the whole time.\\r\\n “Hey.”\\r\\n Hey.\\r\\n “I was just about to call ya.”\\r\\n I was gonna call you. How ya doin’?\\r\\n “I’m good.”\\r\\n Yeah?\\r\\n “Yeah. How was… How was your day?”\\r\\n It was good. Actually, I had a really good day.\\r\\n “Yeah? Tell me about it.”\\r\\n Well, I got up and I actually like, ran…\\r\\n Well, I did actually two hours of… I did yoga and Pilates today.\\r\\n “Both? You’re trying to…”\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n “You were tryin’ to get more ',\n","  'of those in there.”\\r\\n No, I absolutely smashed it. I don’t even…\\r\\n Like, tomorrow I’m just gonna look ridiculously good.\\r\\n “Yeah, no, look, tomorrow you earn popcorn and whatever else.”\\r\\n Yeah, exactly, I’m gonna have… I’m gonna make a lemon square.\\r\\n “Okay. You know how to make those?”\\r\\n Yeah, I haven’t told you. I do know how to make lemon squares.\\r\\n “Is that your thing?”\\r\\n “That’s kind of…”\\r\\n Yeah\\r\\n And I know how to bake sweet potatoes as well.\\r\\n “Okay.”\\r\\n Yeah. That’s kind of it.\\r\\n “I could do one of those I’m not gonna tell you which one.”\\r\\n I bet you could bake a sweet potato but I bet you don’t know that you should put little holes in it.\\r\\n “With a fork? you punch with a fork?”\\r\\n Oh, you must. You absolutely must.\\r\\n “I know. I know a thing or two”\\r\\n And I’m not sure if you wrap your potatoes in foil because there are, like, people that wrap them and people that don’t\\r\\n “Which one are you?”\\r\\n You’ve got to wrap.\\r\\n You’ve got to wrap and poke.\\r\\n “Gotta wrap and poke.”\\r\\n Yeah, ’cause the steams gotta come out but not too much.\\r\\n I don’t know if you letif you let all your steam come out.\\r\\n Is that a plan on lemon squares too, of just the sweet potatoes?\\r\\n No, that’s a whole different thing.\\r\\n I can’t tell you that recipe.\\r\\n “That’s secret.”\\r\\n “All right, how long do I have to wait to… To find out then?”\\r\\n What? My lemon square thing?\\r\\n “Yeah.”\\r\\n I don’t know. My dead great grandmother told it to me so…\\r\\n “Oh, God.”\\r\\n I’m probably not gonna ever tell you.\\r\\n “That’s… I didn’t know I was stepping into an heirloom.”\\r\\n No, it’s fine. She lived a long and healthy life.\\r\\n “It’s a family crest, I was trying to pry it from you.”\\r\\n Yeah. What are you up to?\\r\\n “You know, I’m about to… About to jump in the shower and then head out. I answered un-showered.”\\r\\n But you don’t look like you’re about to jump in the shower.\\r\\n Oh, that’s very nice of you to say.\\r\\n “Take it off.”\\r\\n “You wanna come in with me?”\\r\\n No.\\r\\n “I think I would sacrifice this for this phone.”\\r\\n When was the last time you showered?\\r\\n “I’m tryin’ to give you an exact hour amount.”\\r\\n “I think eighteen hours ago?”\\r\\n Oh, eighteen hours.\\r\\n I thought you were gonna be, like two hours ago.\\r\\n Are you, like, one of those people that shower…\\r\\n Like when we see each other again, are you just gonna be…\\r\\n Like if I come in on the plane are you gonna be like\\r\\n You have to have a shower?\\r\\n I’m gonna come and…\\r\\n I always think that’s so weird. It’s like, can’t we just not do that?\\r\\n Like, I know I’ve been on a plane, but like…\\r\\n “I’m gonna have you guess shower or no shower.”\\r\\n You’re gonna make me shower though when we see each other again?\\r\\n “You should shower for sure.”\\r\\n But like if I haven’t seen you for all this time and I just get off the plane are you gonna be like…\\r\\n “You have to have a shower?”\\r\\n This is a deal breaker for me.\\r\\n “For you?”\\r\\n “Oh. If I make you shower?”\\r\\n Yes! Like straightaway.\\r\\n “No, I trust your sort of, uh, judgment on that.”\\r\\n Okay, fine, I’ll just shower before.\\r\\n “That’s up to you. I’m not gonna… I’m not gonna tell you what to do. I mean I will judge you…”\\r\\n Yeah, don’t control me. Stop it.\\r\\n “Yeah, no more… Yeah, that comes later.”\\r\\n No.\\r\\n “That comes later.”\\r\\n “I like looking at your face.”\\r\\n Shut up.\\r\\n “No?”\\r\\n “You can see your face too the little square in the bottom.”\\r\\n No, I look like a thumb.\\r\\n “That’s ’cause your thumb’s in the way.”\\r\\n It is not. I just…\\r\\n You look like… You look really dewy.\\r\\n You’re like all smooth and stuff.\\r\\n “Jews are smooth?”\\r\\n No! You’re all dewy.\\r\\n Not about you being Jew…\\r\\n You always bring it back to being Jewish. No.\\r\\n “You said I looked Jewy…”\\r\\n No, like…\\r\\n “And then you said I look smooth.”\\r\\n No, dewy like a pancake.\\r\\n “Chewy?”\\r\\n No! Dewy.\\r\\n Dewy. Like you moisturize a lot. Doesn’t matter. Whatever.\\r\\n “Is that a translation thing?”\\r\\n No, no, “Is it a language… Is it a cultural thing?”\\r\\n Dewy. Do you guys not say dewy?\\r\\n “No, Jewy means like…”\\r\\n Dewy, like smooth.\\r\\n “Jewish shit.”\\r\\n Okay, sorry.\\r\\n “I’m glad we clarified that ’cause that could be a problem.”\\r\\n No, you know, like a dewy Jew.\\r\\n “Right. Is that… Wait are we pancake or Holocaust?”\\r\\n Stop.\\r\\n You’re such an idiot.\\r\\n “Which Jewy… you gotta specify.”\\r\\n Shut up.\\r\\n ',\n","  '“’cause now I’m completely lost.”\\r\\n “Is that a British thing?\\r\\n I had my eyebrows tweezed today.\\r\\n “Oh, okay! It was yoga Pilates and eyebrows.”\\r\\n Yeah. I just went in this place opposite and I felt…\\r\\n You know, like when somebody like, does something for you and you feel like all warm and gooey inside?\\r\\n Like this woman took real care about like, tweezing my eyebrows.\\r\\n And she was like showing me how to draw them in and stuff and I just, I don’t know it was really sweet.\\r\\n “Did she tweeze them or thread them?”\\r\\n No, she was tweezing them. Yeah.\\r\\n “Oh, tweezwith the tweezers?

I’m thirty-two.\\r\\n Okay, if you’re thirty, you better either be married or have herpes.\\r\\n Like, pick one. Commit to something commit to a person or a way of life. Like, who are you?\\r\\n Three decades nothing to show for it?\\r\\n Figure it the fuck out. Marriage or herpes.\\r\\n Pick. Pick!\\r\\n A lot of my friends got married.\\r\\n I got herpes.\\r\\n At least mine is gonna last forever.\\r\\n People get fucked up about it, though.\\r\\n They get, like, fucked up about it! Like, people get fucked up!\\r\\n They hear that they have it, they get fucked up, and you shouldn’t.\\r\\n It’s not that big of a deal.\\r\\n But there’s like a sense of shame associated with it.\\r\\n ‘Cause society will imbue you with a sense of shame for something that’s on your body.\\r\\n Which is, like, that’s body shaming.\\r\\n That’s textbook body shaming.\\r\\n It’s on my body and you’re shaming me for it?\\r\\n That’s literally what body shaming is.\\r\\n No one gets behind that cause. Like, no one’s ev…\\r\\n Where’s that Dove ad campaign?\\r\\n Where’s that brave Instagram post?\\r\\n That would be brave.\\r\\n That’s a brave Instagram post. A fresh outbreak.\\r\\n Woke up like this. Like, that’s fucking brave as shit.\\r\\n That’s way braver than you with no makeup.\\r\\n I don’t know how you’re keeping score on bravery but I’m pretty sure that that wins.\\r\\n It’s not even that big of a deal.\\r\\n Right? It’s like that’s something I learned.\\r\\n It’s not as big of a deal as they make it seem so I feel like if you have it you shouldn’t let yourself get fucked up about it.\\r\\n Like don’t let it affect your sense of self.\\r\\n It’s fine.\\r\\n If you don’t have it, get it!\\r\\n Just get it!\\r\\n Then it’s over, that’s it. You’re done!\\r\\n You know what I mean? Like it’s kind of better.\\r\\n Like, I used to not have it. And now I do and it’s like… I remember I used to always worry about getting it…\\r\\n But now I don’t. That’s pretty nice.\\r\\n There’s something liberating about that.\\r\\n Like, it’s liberating to not have to worry anymore.\\r\\n Also, if we all got it, then it’s kind of like no one has it anymore which is… That’s basically a cure.\\r\\n Make it the new normal a',\n","  'nd that’s it.\\r\\n I get a lot of questions. Like a lot… People always…\\r\\n My friend, she was like “Is it hard to date now?”\\r\\n Is it hard to date now? What do you mean now?\\r\\n Like, what made you think this was easy before?\\r\\n You think herpes is some new problem?\\r\\n Like, my personality much bigger problem than herpes.\\r\\n Herpes is like number eighteen on the list of fuckin’ things in the way.\\r\\n What, do you think it’s uncomfortable?\\r\\n Oh, you think it’s an uncomfortable conversation?\\r\\n Listen, if I’m dating someone and they think that’s uncomfortable wait till I deconstruct your sense of self so I feel superior.\\r\\n That’s way more uncomfortable.\\r\\n Wait till she hears my fucked-up perspective on shit.\\r\\n Look, any girl in the world would rather hear her boyfriend say “Hey, I have HSV-two” than…\\r\\n “Hey you know, nine-eleven was just occupy Wall Street done right.”\\r\\n That’s way more uncomfortable than a very treatable STD that everyone already kind of has anyway.\\r\\n Is dating hard? I don’t know.\\r\\n Sure. Depends who you are.\\r\\n I don’t like the first date. The first date is like, I don’t like it.\\r\\n I don’t like hangin’ out with strangers.\\r\\n It’s like two hours with a stranger.\\r\\n I don’t drink either so it’s like what do you do?\\r\\n Dinner? I go to dinner.\\r\\n That’s what I do. Dinner.\\r\\n It’s too much pressure on the first date.\\r\\n Dinner?\\r\\n It’s just you and a menu and this person.\\r\\n Good luck.\\r\\n Just sittin’ there in your little section.\\r\\n You gotta make small talk off the menu.\\r\\n She’s like “Oh, what should I get?” It’s like, I don’t care.\\r\\n I don’t love you.\\r\\n Chicken.\\r\\n Oh, they got glazed carrots, let’s get ’em!\\r\\n Roasted Brussels sprouts. Yeah, great.\\r\\n We’re gettin’ roasted Brussels sprouts.\\r\\n Remember when we were kids Brussels sprouts were like the worst thing and now we all, like, love ’em?\\r\\n We’re all fuckin’ sellouts.\\r\\n I don’t wanna date someone I don’t love.\\r\\n I wanna date someone I love.\\r\\n That’s the move.\\r\\n You wanna date someone you love!\\r\\n Who do I love? Not a lotta people.\\r\\n I guess where all that Freudian shit comes from ’cause it’s like yeah, your mom is the best option.\\r\\n Like on a love level… I know it’s weird and gross\\r\\n We don’t do it, but, like, wouldn’t it be awesome if we did?\\r\\n Like, imagine a universe where that was totally the deal.\\r\\n Like, that’s a better universe.\\r\\n It’s a better… Like just come out of the womb day one like, “Found her.” Like, that’s better.\\r\\n I don’t need to fuck with strangers I got the oxytocin queen right here.\\r\\n I guess that’s why the mom sits up front at the wedding cause it’s like “Well, it would’ve been you but blech so I had to go find someone I never knew. I had to turn a stranger into the love of my life.”\\r\\n On a love level though, like, who do I love more than my mom?\\r\\n Nobody.\\r\\n Who does she love more than me? Nobody.\\r\\n It is right there.\\r\\n It’s like we both love each other more than anything let’s figure this out. We can’t figure this out?\\r\\n There’s no permutation where this can fuckin’ work?\\r\\n It’s frustrating. She’s single too, not that it matters but it’s like, she’s single, I’m not saying, like, “Oh I have a chance”\\r\\n I’m like, she, my mom, is single.\\r\\n She’s, like, alone. I don’t want my mom to be alone.\\r\\n I want my… I want her to be with someone that she’s into.\\r\\n And I’m not saying, like “Oh, my mom is into me” but if we were not related she would be.\\r\\n Like, in another universe I would be her type.\\r\\n And I know it’s weird to think but to be fair I only think that because she told me that so don’t shoot the messenger.\\r\\n She’s like “Oh, you would so be my type.”\\r\\n And I’m like, “Well, what do you want me to do with that?”\\r\\n “Yeah, I wish I could. I would love to.”\\r\\n “I would love to give you me. That would make me so happy.”\\r\\n “For you to be with a guy who loves you who is so far out of your league.”\\r\\n That would be nice. And I am outta my mom’s league.\\r\\n I’m not saying that arrogantly I don’t think I’m like the best looking person.\\r\\n I just know I would never consider sleeping with a sixty-one year old woman who looked like that unless she were my mom. Like, that’s her only in. I’d have to really give a shit about how happy it made her. Like, random sixty-year-old lady, get the f',\n","  'uck outta here!\\r\\n But my mom, it’s like…\\r\\n Well, yeah I want my mom to get fucked.\\r\\n You want your mom to get fucked.\\r\\n You just don’t wanna know when.\\r\\n But I wanna know that it’s happening for sure I just don’t wanna know when it hap… I just I don’t her to like, walk out of her bedroom, like…\\r\\n Like I don’t want that moment.\\r\\n But I wanna know that it is happening and what better way to now that something’s happening for sure than to just do it yourself.\\r\\n And that’s what I’m saying is I wish I could guarantee for her what I know she deserves.\\r\\n For her. It’s not even for me.\\r\\n I don’t win this, she wins. Right?\\r\\n Because any reasonable person would admit you would rather fuck your kid than your parent.\\r\\n That’s not controversial. That’s not controversial.\\r\\n That is… You would rather fuck your kid than your parent.\\r\\n For sure. People try to fuck their kids all the time.\\r\\n Nobody tries to fuck their parents.\\r\\n You never read that in the news like a ring of parent fuckers was broken up by the FBI in a sting operation.\\r\\n Uh, parent fucking is rampant in Hollywood and Washington and the music business and…\\r\\n Anyway, my point is I don’t think anyone gives a shit about the herpes anymore.\\r\\n “Hey”\\r\\n Hey\\r\\n Why are you still up?\\r\\n Why are you still up? It’s my bedtime.\\r\\n “Yeah.”\\r\\n You’ve been out?\\r\\n “Kind of. What…”\\r\\n You’re drunk and I’m asleep.\\r\\n “Define out.”\\r\\n I don’t know, like out.\\r\\n “I got a falafel with a friend.”\\r\\n You got a falafel?\\r\\n “Is that out?”\\r\\n Uh… It…\\r\\n Do you have, like bits of falafel in your mouth?\\r\\n I always have like have like…\\r\\n “Right now?”\\r\\n Like, I don’t really get falafel. It’s just like… like eating, like, dust.\\r\\n “It’s a little chalky, I admit that.”\\r\\n It’s so dry. I just don’t understand the falafel obsession.\\r\\n “Yeah, I don’t know if it’s an obsession as much as it is…”\\r\\n “It was open.”\\r\\n Oh, right.\\r\\n “I’m obsessed with places that are open.”\\r\\n Do you ever, like, um, order something on delivery and then you’re like you go past it in the day and you’re, like, “What the fuck?”\\r\\n Like, “I would never order from that place?”\\r\\n Or, like, “I’d never go into that place and eat.”\\r\\n “Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. ’cause it… It has the…”\\r\\n ‘Cause it’s disgusting.\\r\\n “Right.”\\r\\n “On the internet it’s only the number of stars.”\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n “And, so, they’re like, okay, four-star… star rating on restaurants is, like, the only time I trust random people in the world.”\\r\\n “Like, Oh, four and a half stars like, then it has to be good.”\\r\\n “But it’s like these are the same people who… are on trains and vote.”\\r\\n Are you one of those people who like, always has to look up the restaurant before you go and see if it’s nice?\\r\\n “I… yeah. I’m… I’m…”\\r\\n I can tell.\\r\\n “I’m a four and a half star or above.”\\r\\n Why do you look so scrumptious?\\r\\n “I look scrunched up right now?”\\r\\n You look scrummy.\\r\\n “What does that mean?”\\r\\n Like if I was there right now I’d snog you.\\r\\n “Scrummy?”\\r\\n Yeah, like scrumptious.\\r\\n “Oh, I see. Is this a good thing?”\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n “Okay.”\\r\\n Yeah, like I wanna snig… Snig you no snog you. Snog and a kiss… No, what’s a snig? A snog and a kiss is a snigu.\\r\\n “All right.”\\r\\n I mean, I’m really tired.\\r\\n “These are… these are all new expressions to me.”\\r\\n No, I just… I think I’m weird jet lag.\\r\\n I also came home and my brother… has done something to the toilet.\\r\\n “What did he do?”\\r\\n He’s been staying here when I went away… I don’t know, but it’s making a weird noise.\\r\\n And when we were kids, like every time we go on holiday we just… Like my mom would have to get, um, a coat hanger and put it on the toilet because it… They’re just so long.\\r\\n “She’d have to use a coat hanger for the toilet?”\\r\\n A coat hanger, yeah, or like a piece of bamboo if we’re on holiday.\\r\\n And I know he’s done something to it, and he…\\r\\n “Where’s bamboo readily available?”\\r\\n It’s not. It’s not here.\\r\\n “Where do you have to go?”\\r\\n It’s tracking it down.\\r\\n “Yeah. How is your mom?”\\r\\n My mom?\\r\\n “Yeah.”\\r\\n She’s good.\\r\\n “Was it good seeing her?”\\r\\n Yeah. Yeah, I went round for dinner.\\r\\n They’ve just moved house.\\r\\n “Did they?”\\r\\n Yeah. My dad’s having…\\r\\n “Oh, right.”\\r\\n Like a bit of a mid-life crisis ’cause they’ve moved to a smaller house.\\r\\n “Yeah, you were saying something ab',\n","  'out that with the moving.”\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n “So he’s… He’s freaking out?”\\r\\n He’s freaking out ’cause he doesn’t have, like, what… He doesn’t, yeah. It’s a smaller house. And he thinks he’s like getting old and he’s gonna die in a small house.\\r\\n “Well, he is, I mean, I don’t know.”\\r\\n I don’t know. It’s like, I don’t know, it’s like a thing, it’s like, I don’t know, it’s like he’s giving up. But he’s buying it… I don’t know.\\r\\n They’re getting another one.\\r\\n “He’s giving up?”\\r\\n This is all. He’s just an idiot.\\r\\n Yeah. He’s not an idiot but it’s just stupid stuff to…\\r\\n “Right.”\\r\\n Worry about.\\r\\n Yeah, I think about that, like, I…\\r\\n “You know, you look at people who are, like… in the mid-life age you know, and you go like…”\\r\\n “Ah, that looks like it sucks.”\\r\\n “And you’re like, Wait, that’s next.”\\r\\n Yeah, maybe for you, not for me.\\r\\n “Well, I mean it’s next…”\\r\\n I’m a young little spring chicken.\\r\\n “Yeah, but that ends.”\\r\\n Whatever. No. I was thinking that, like…\\r\\n Am I gonna get to a certain age where no one fancies me anymore and then I was just, like, no.\\r\\n “You say no?”\\r\\n I don’t think… I don’t think it’s gonna happen.\\r\\n “That’s because you’re young.”\\r\\n No, but I think, like…\\r\\n “That’s a young thing to think.”\\r\\n No, no, but, like, even…\\r\\n No, like, I don’t know.\\r\\n I was just thinking, like I’m sure someone will be up for it when I’m, like, forty.\\r\\n “No, totally. But then…”\\r\\n “But just the selection of people gets weirder.”\\r\\n No, they don’t.\\r\\n “I think it does.”\\r\\n “Right?”\\r\\n I have a hard time with intimacy.\\r\\n I have, like, intimacy issues.\\r\\n Any time I get into, like an intimate moment I feel like just… I gotta get the fuck outta there.\\r\\n “It’s just a feeling any time I see vulnerability”\\r\\n I gotta get the fuck outta there.\\r\\n And your brain is really good at justifying how you feel so if you feel like you gotta leave a situation then your brain will find reasons why you should.\\r\\n So it’ll come back with all this intel, like reasons to leave.\\r\\n And it’s hard to know if those are like legitimate red flags or just you justifying some weird insecurity.\\r\\n It’s hard to… To discern between the two “and that’s where I think therapy can be helpful.”\\r\\n Therapy kinda helps you like unmask your phobia. Like, any phobia you’re having therapy kinda gets like underneath it.\\r\\n Therapy, to me, is kinda like the last scene of Scooby Doo.\\r\\n That last sce… every episode of Scooby Doo is the same. The whole episode they’re like “Ah, it’s a ghost!”\\r\\n And they take the mask off they’re like…\\r\\n “Oh, it’s the guy who owns the bakery,” or whatever.\\r\\n That’s what I think therapy does for…\\r\\n For your emotions.\\r\\n You’re in a relationship and you’re like… I don’t know, she’s a little boring and therapy is like…\\r\\n You’re like, “Oh, my parents never showed me what love looked like.”\\r\\n “I thought she was bad at telling stories.”\\r\\n Turns out I have no foundation.\\r\\n I’m broken irreparably from the inside.\\r\\n “I’m flying blind without a map.”\\r\\n I’m replicating a power dynamic instead of reciprocity.\\r\\n Silly me.\\r\\n I thought she used the wrong form of ”you’re” in a text message.\\r\\n Turns out I downloaded my sexual identity from movies.\\r\\n You ever do that? You ever think you’re a person “and you’re actually an amalgamation of projections you’ve absorbed over thirty-two years?”\\r\\n That is brutal.\\r\\n I do think that there’s like a weird impact, that, like, movies can have.\\r\\n Maybe it just exacerbates superficialities.\\r\\n I don’t like when I get into that when I’m, like tricked by superficial shit\\r\\n Like I…\\r\\n Even when I’m not like, attracted to somebody I’m, like…\\r\\n What’s goin’ on?\\r\\n When I’m attracted to someone I’m, like, “Oh, nice face.”\\r\\n And then I’m gonna, what, overrate the ideas that come out of it?\\r\\n Right? ‘Cause, like the face and the body that’s just like, the marketing team of the self.\\r\\n And when I’m attracted to that I’m being, like, tricked.\\r\\n I feel like I’m being tricked.\\r\\n Like, I’m on the phone at four in the morning with an infomercial… Like, Hey, I saw your thing. I’d like to b… It’s…\\r\\n No! Wait till you see the thing!\\r\\n But you can’t see the thing.\\r\\n You can’t see the thing immediately.\\r\\n You have to… It’s the… You just see the face and the body.\\r\\n What’s the per',\n","  'sonality like? That’s way more important.\\r\\n But that takes time, it takes patience, it takes energy it takes focus to notice.\\r\\n The face is right there.\\r\\n Maybe the personality’s fucked up.\\r\\n I think if you have a fucked up personality you should have a fucked up face.\\r\\n I don’t think you should get to have it the other way.\\r\\n Like, when I look at your face I don’t wanna see flesh.\\r\\n I wanna see, like, nine months living in a one bedroom apartment with you, like, here.\\r\\n Like that’s what… That’s what this should be.\\r\\n All this shit. Hair.\\r\\n I don’t wanna see hair.\\r\\n What is hair?\\r\\n “Oh, you have nice hair.” Who gives a shit? Hair?\\r\\n Hair is protein that arbitrarily grows out of your head against your will.\\r\\n And you have nice that? Awesome.\\r\\n It’s an aesthetic thing.\\r\\n If something is gonna grow out of your head I don’t wanna see hair I wanna see like, long flowing locks of your ability to keep a secret.\\r\\n That’s what should come outta your head.\\r\\n That way someone flips it back “Oh, I can trust that person.”\\r\\n And we can continue not trusting bald people like we normally do except we wouldn’t be superficial shitheads for it, we’d be right.\\r\\n Yeah, I can’t trust that dude.\\r\\n He has… He doesn’t have the secret-keeping substance coming out of his skull.\\r\\n Fuck that bald asshole! And you’d be right!\\r\\n That would be a legitimate thing to say as opposed to a low-key hate crime like it is now.\\r\\n You can’t call someone a bald asshole.\\r\\n I didn’t pick that.\\r\\n There’s all sorts of things I can do to become more attractive, too.\\r\\n I can, like, make myself more attractive.\\r\\n I can work out, I can get in shape.\\r\\n That would make me more attractive.\\r\\n I can get abs, people would be more attracted to me which is weird because all abs mean is I did this a lot.\\r\\n Like, that’s literally all it means is I tricked my body into thinking it was building a house.\\r\\n Like, that’s what abs are it’s an exploitation of an evolutionary glitch.\\r\\n People go, “Oh, he did this a lot.”\\r\\n He’ll make a great date.\\r\\n Like, how? How does that track?\\r\\n You should only be able to get abs by doing something good.\\r\\n Like, you should have to… In order to get a…\\r\\n You should have to like help the elderly, that would make sense.\\r\\n Like, you help an old lady cross the street and get ripped\\r\\n Like, okay, yeah, sure, I buy that.\\r\\n That way you see a guy on the beach with washboard abs you can be like “Oh, well he loves his grandma”\\r\\n Like, you would know something about him other than he did this a lot after work four times a week.\\r\\n He did the side-to-side one probably.\\r\\n Look at that.\\r\\n He probably used a medicine ball.\\r\\n What a cool guy! It’s fucking stupid.\\r\\n But we are attracted to these things.\\r\\n We’re attracted to, you know, what we’re attracted to and as a society when we are all attracted to certain things we create this, like external value system and when you live inside of that you internalize that as your own.\\r\\n So, you feel a sense of internal pride or shame based on how closely you correlate to that… That value system.\\r\\n So, people get fucked up about how they look that’s well documented. People also get…\\r\\n It’s weird like, people take pride like, there’s a weird pride people take in how they loo Like, there’s men who take, like pri…\\r\\n They have, like, dick pride like pride in their di… Like…\\r\\n My fuckin’ dick! Like, they talk about their dick like it’s a son that graduated from Harvard.\\r\\n Like, where’s the pride…\\r\\n My fuckin’ dick!\\r\\n Oh, my biit’s not even my dick. I’m its body.\\r\\n Like what are you talk… Like…\\r\\n My fuckin’ dick.\\r\\n My big-ass di… It’s like, “So?”\\r\\n How’d you get it?\\r\\n It’s like, “Dude it just showed up!”\\r\\n Your dick should only be as big as your heart.\\r\\n And it should only be as girthy as your capacity for change.\\r\\n That way you see a fat dick you go…\\r\\n “Oh, that’s a spiritually open malleable human being.”\\r\\n You sit on a fat dick I can feel his open mindedness stretching me out.\\r\\n That desire he has to transcend his past mistakes.\\r\\n It feels good.\\r\\n It makes me feel full.\\r\\n I’m attracted to things I’m attracted to… Eyes. I like eyes.\\r\\n I’m attracted to eyes. Not, like, in a bag but, like, on a head. Eyes. I like my eyes on heads.\\r\\n Two eyes for',\n","  ' every one head. That’s the ratio that I like.\\r\\n You can have whatever ratio you want.\\r\\n I like eyes. But even that’s weird.\\r\\n I like the eye, but then it’s like…\\r\\n “Oh, now I wanna like, fuck you. Why?”\\r\\n “‘Cause you have nice eyes?” That’s a weird leap to make.\\r\\n To go, like “Oh, yeah, these eyes are cool.”\\r\\n “Let’s fuck the other…” This other part of you.\\r\\n It’s not even the same… It’s not even on the same part of the body.\\r\\n It’s a different part.\\r\\n The vagina. And it’s like I like it, but it’s like…\\r\\n I just it doesn’t tell me anything about you.\\r\\n I don’t know you. I don’t know wha…\\r\\n You know what I mean? Like the vagin… Like the…\\r\\n I don’t wanna fuck a vagina.\\r\\n I would much rather fuck like a warm, wet sense of discipline.\\r\\n Like, I wanna go down on your long-term focus.\\r\\n I wanna… I wanna eat out your determination.\\r\\n I wanna make your perseverance squirt.\\r\\n That’s a much more appealing activity.\\r\\n I wanna shove my personality into your determination and then reach around and tickle your integrity like, that’s kind of the world I wanna live in.\\r\\n I just hope your integrity doesn’t include your ability to keep a secret because that is a phobia of mine.\\r\\n I’m not a perfect person.\\r\\n It’s all fear.\\r\\n I mean, all this shit… All this shit I talk about, it’s all fear.\\r\\n It comes from a…\\r\\n Deep rooted sense of fear. I’m afraid.\\r\\n I’m afraid to get close to somebody.\\r\\n I’m afraid to lose the person I get close to.\\r\\n “I’m afraid they can hurt me in a way that no one else can.”\\r\\n “Why do you look so scrumptious?”\\r\\n “I look scrunched up right now?”\\r\\n You’re scrummy.\\r\\n “What does that mean?”\\r\\n Like, if I was there right now I’d snog you.\\r\\n I’m afraid that if I let someone in past the walls that I’ve built up for myself that they’ll…\\r\\n See parts of myself that I haven’t accepted or I don’t like, or parts of me that are fucked up, or flawed or broken, or weird, or wrong or inadequate or boring.\\r\\n Parts of myself that are missing, like…\\r\\n Where’s that part of your personality?\\r\\n Like, I don’t know.\\r\\n Maybe it’ll show me a part of myself that I haven’t…\\r\\n That I haven’t even looked at… It’s all fear.\\r\\n And so I push people away.\\r\\n And it’s not in, like, fun ways. It’s not like…\\r\\n I’m not like I’m rolling them down the sidewalk in an office chair.\\r\\n It’s… Sometimes it’s harsh.\\r\\n And, you know, this is something I have to reckon with.\\r\\n But it’s just because I’m afraid of the alternative.\\r\\n “And so what do you do about it?”\\r\\n I just try to be honest.\\r\\n “That might be the funniest thing you’ve ever said.”\\r\\n You think this is honest?\\r\\n Honesty’s, like, it’s being open and being vulnerable.\\r\\n It’s not just standing in front of everyone and telling them that you fucking suck. Fuck off, dude!\\r\\n Like get the fuck over yourself.\\r\\n It’s fuckin’ boring.

I have a hard time with people, so here we go.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Well, it’s always been hard for me to connect with people throughout my whole life, and I think there’s, you know, a lot of reasons for that. Um, I have a hearing loss that I’ve had since I was a kid. When I was three years old… I failed a hearing test. I took a hearing test and the doctor said, “You failed the hearing test.” Well, I didn’t know what he said, but…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n …he said something, and my parents got upset, so I assumed I didn’t nail it, and… So he told my parents, he said, “This kid needs hearing aids.” And so instead of doing that, they didn’t. So we just…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n …coasted until I was 21. I didn’t wear them till I was 21. I wore them for like a week when I was in fifth grade, but then this girl I had a crush on asked about them. She’s like, “What’s in your ear?” I was like, “Well, that’s the end of that forever.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “So I’ll figure… I’ll figure it out.” It instilled this kinda sense of shame in me. You know, I took it as something was wrong with me. I put it on myself. I go, “I must be fucked up.” And then I’m like, “No, my doctor fucked up.” And then my friends were like, “No, dude, your parents, your parents fucked up.” And it’s like, “Oh, cool, well, add it to their tab.”\\r\\n Like, I don’t know…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n They got a long tab running, you know. Also, they got divorced when I was 12, which is, like, the most “fuck you” age you could possibly…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Like, you guys weren’t, like, killing it when I was five. You couldn’t have done it then? You had to wait until I was 12? They did do the thing where they… This is a common thing I think parents do when they get divorced, they tell their kids… They told me, “It’s not your fault. Don’t worry, it’s not your fault.” It’s like, “Yeah, first of all, I wasn’t thinking that. Uh… I don’t know why you thought I thought it was on me. Have you seen you guys? Mom is cripplingly insecure, and Dad’s addicted to prostitutes. On what fucking world is this on me?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n I didn’t have a good blueprint… for what a relationship should look like, so, you know, I’ve struggled accordingly. I’ve had issues in relationships. There’s other reasons for that, too. Like it can’t be a good thing… (CHUCKLES) It can’t be a good thing that the first… 2,000… sexual experiences of my life…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n …were with a Dell computer. Like that can’t be…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n It can’t be helping. It can’t be pushing me in the right direction on this pursuit of love and happiness that I’m on. Two thousand. That’s the number, by the way. I didn’t, like, write down a funny number for you. I counted.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s literally 2,000, age 12 to 19 was exclusively that every single day. I bought a computer for my family with my bar mitzvah money, and then I fucked it for seven years straight.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n That’s how I began. That is the origin story to my sexual identity, just downloading sexist shit into my head. Then waltzing out into the world like, “Oh, yeah, I totally respect people.” How? How is that even possible? It’s so corrosive. That shit will rot your brain. And it’s certainly, for a young boy, like, it’s insane. Even now, it’s like… We like to pretend like it’s fine, but that’s only because we don’t have to acknowledge what it is that we’re doing. It’s like this virtual, wordless escapade. You never have to be accountable for what it is you’re doing. I think before… you’re allowed to click on a video… you should have to say the title out loud.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n How badly do you want this? I feel like most people are like, “I’m just gonna call my mom and reconnect… the person I need to be.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n And it’s bled in. Yeah, my relationship dynamics have always been somewhat turbulent. A lot of back and forth, break up, get back together kind of things. A lot of things that start really quickly. It’s like immediate intensity, you know? Because usually I feel like shit about myself and they feel like shit about themselves, and we come together and we’re like, “Well, we have each other. And we can do all this stuff! We can do all this stuff together now that we’re both here. We can rub each other’s heads. We can take naps together. We can, like, slow dance in the kitchen while we’re waiting for our cookies to finish baking.” How specific do you want me to get?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n But then when I have all that stuff, I’m able to see, I’m like, “Oh, this is a very codependent relationship, this isn’t healthy. This isn’t the kind of thing I wanna be in long term. You’re not the person that’s right for me.” So I’ll be like, “Maybe we should break up.” But then they leave, they take all the stuff! I’m like, “I wanna break up with you, but you should love me still. Like, you should still give me all the things, just don’t ask me for anything.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Like, “I need you. Like, this is all built off of the back of y',\n","  'ou. Like, your love for me gave me the confidence to even feel like I could break up with you.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “I never would’ve broken up with you if I was by myself.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n But it’s a self-esteem thing. I don’t feel… I don’t feel, like, good enough for the person that I… that would be right for me, you know? So, what if… I play this in my head. What it feels like I need to do is I need to find a girlfriend, uh, in order to be confident enough to be the type of person that I would need to be in order to attract the girl that I actually want to be with.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n On my own, I’m nothing, but in a relationship, I’m kind of a catch.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES) I feel like this is a common phenomenon, that love at first sight, that idea, it gets propagated. We all know what you mean by it, “love at first sight.” And it’s something that’s a really enchanting idea, you know? ‘Cause you’re like, you know, one minute you’re alone, the next minute you’ve found the one. It’s like, “What a… What a day.” (CHUCKLES)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n What a day that would be. And so it’s so enticing, but I’ve seen… I’ve gone that route so many times, I know what’s on the back end of it, so it’s hard for me not to be cynical about it. Now when I hear people like, “We knew right away…” Did you? ‘Cause now anytime I hear someone say about their own relationship, “We knew right away,” all I hear is, “We were both abandoned as children.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n You knew right away? Your threshold for loving a person is you saw them once? That seems like a low bar to clear.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n I feel like maybe you can’t handle the anxiety of uncertainty, so you went from zero to 100 right away to skip over that prospect of rejection and the risk that they might not be who you imagine them to be. Am I close? Am I fucking close? -Like, I feel like that…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n …is a more accurate characterization of what we’re talking about. If you’re drawn to somebody that quickly, that strongly, that intensely, that immediately, that’s not love. You probably have unresolved trauma.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n And the other person probably represents an embodiment of the trigger of that trauma, so you’re drawn to them in this misguided attempt to retroactively fix a fucked-up period in your past. That’s not love! Don’t call that love. Don’t rebrand that as love and make the rest of us feel bad. Don’t be out in the world like, “It was love at first sight.” Say something honest like, “It was ‘I felt the way I did when my dad left’ at first sight.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n I’ll believe that. I’ll believe that, yeah. “My husband’s face looks just like the back of my father’s head, so I chased it…”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “…to now.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n You should not be chasing. Don’t chase. Love should not be chased. (GASPS) You shouldn’t have that, like, “Are we gonna make it?” (CHUCKLES) No!\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n If you’re wondering, no. You should not be chasing. Like in movies, like, to propagate this idea, “chase them,” and that rom-com fantasy of chasing someone to an airport. Chase a therapist to an airport. Like, don’t… Like, “Don’t leave, we have so much work to do!”\\r\\n Like, that’s…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES) No, ’cause movies have to show you… They can’t show you what love actually is. We don’t wanna see it. Love isn’t entertaining. They have to show some dramatic, conflicted version of love. They don’t… We don’t wanna see love, actual love. It’s beautiful. I’m not shitting on the sentiment. It’s an amazing thing between the two people. It’s not fun to watch. Think about a couple you know, maybe you are that couple, who are truly in love, in love, like, together, good, healthy. We don’t wanna watch that. Like, if you wanna…\\r\\n If you…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n If you watched a movie about a couple in love, you would just be on your couch watching a couple on their couch, watching a better movie.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n You’re like, “Why… What are they watching? I’ll just watch that. Why don’t we cut out… cut out the middleman? I don’t need…”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, my God. That’s not what they show you. ‘Cause we don’t wanna see… We don’t wanna see healthy, good love. We wanna see, like, a manifestation of, like, our own internal dramas played out… for entertainment value. The problem is there are people out there, like when I was a kid, who are like empty canvases, who internalized that. And so it starts to skew their view of what love could be. Like, people who don’t have a healthy blueprint are gonna absorb that and take that in. You know, I was 12 years old when the movie Titanic came out, and that was, like, iconic love story. Like, here it is, epic love, cruelly interrupted by fate. And I look at that movie now, I’m like, “Wait, what were we rooting for here? What did we want to happen? For them to get to New York? They weren’t gonna make it as a couple.” What did we think? They’re 20 years old, they’ve known each other two days. I don’t know everything about relationships, but like, hey, maybe don’t',\n","  ' marry the artist you fucked on a cruise.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n Maybe that’s not the move. Five minutes after you tried to kill yourself. Do you remember that’s how they met? She was trying to kill herself by jumping off the boat, and he was like, “Hey, I’m pretty hot. What if you didn’t do that?” And so…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n That’s how they started. They knew right away. Like, that’s the thing, is like, what happens? How is that gonna play out? Even if they get to New York, what? -They have nothing in common.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n You know what I mean? Like, all they have is the excitement that they made it. That lasts, what? Six months, a year… two years, maybe? What happens five, ten years down the road? Just sittin’ there. He’s like, “So… you want me to draw you?” She’s like, “Fuck you!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “I was engaged to a billionaire. I had to sell that necklace to pay the heating bill. You haven’t sold a sketch in years, Jack. How’s that art gallery going, Jack?” He’s like, “Oh, come on. Remember when we danced -with the common folk?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Terrible. It would’ve been terrible. People are like, “Oh, it’s so sad what happened. If they didn’t hit the iceberg…” Fuck that! The iceberg is the hero of that movie. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It might’ve killed Jack, but it saved the rest of Rose’s life.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n I like movies, I do. I do. I don’t like movie culture, though, like Hollywood… like the culture surrounding it. And every time I get roped into watching an award show, I’m always reminded, like, who the fuck makes these things. It’s like, “Oh, my God.” You ever watch an award show? It’s like this shouldn’t be on television. This should be, like… like, in an underground cave at Bohemian Grove. Like, why is this in front of the public? ‘Cause they try to act like they’re down-to-earth. Every time an actor wins an award, they always give some… It’s not some, like, normal speech, it’s like a lofty, sociopolitical response to the moment. It’s like, “We need to find a way. There’s a lot of problems in the world. We need to find a way to come together and not let it divide us.” Like Meryl Streep, “We need to come together.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Find unity and strength, and break down the barriers that keep us apart. -And find strength and unity.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Come together as a globe, as a nation, as a people.” I’m always like, “Yeah, uh, you’re wearing a diamond dress from Givenchy.” Like, on what fucking planet are you part of “the people”?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Like, what do you think? Like, if there was a true people’s revolution, like a people’s uprising, it’s gonna be your blood -splattered on the sidewalk.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n They’re not gonna spare you ’cause they liked Devil Wears Prada. They’re gonna rip your fucking head off, stick it on a stake, and sell that diamond dress to a cartel for machine guns.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n They’re not gonna be like, “Oh, get in the bunker. We love the nuance of your artistic choices. It was so brave of you, how you dared, oh, how you dared to be a middle-class character.” Like, “Oh, how you pretended to be a thing people are their entire lives. How did you do it? How did you prepare for the role?” And they’re always like, “Oh, I lived amongst plumbers -for eight months.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “I lived how they lived. I ate how they ate.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n No, that’s it, you can’t. You can’t preach togetherness and unity when you’re that rich. You just can’t do it. You’re rich. You’re super rich. That’s why you got rich, is to get the fuck away from everybody.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n That’s what money is. Money is just an escape from people. That’s why we want it. Everything money does for you. Doesn’t even have to be a lot of money. You’d be like, “Ooh, I can afford an Uber.” What’s an Uber? That is a bus for one person.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n It’s like, “Yeah, I like the bus. I just wish there were no people on it and it only went where I want it to go.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Yeah, you can do that. You gotta pay for it. You wanna join a gym, there’s different kinds of gyms, right? There’s a whole spectrum of gym options. There’s a ten-dollar-a-month gym on one end. Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym on the other end. What’s the difference? Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym, it’s nicer. It’s not 20 times nicer. It’s not like the ten-dollar-a-month gym, the walls are falling off, and you pick up the ten-pound weight and it’s 100 pounds. You’re like, “Oh, fuck this gym! The dumbbells are Gatorade bottles filled with rocks, this gym sucks.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n No, there’s still equipment there. The 200-dollar-a-month gym, you pay 200 dollars a month so you don’t have to look at people who can only afford ten dollars a month.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n That’s what you’re paying for. You wanna be able to do a pull-up without being reminded of the dark underbelly of capitalism.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s a 190-dollar surcharge to not have to make eye contact with the consolation prize in this fucked-up game we’re all playing here. That’s w',\n","  'hat you’re paying for. That’s the premium. Everything money does for you just pushes you further and further away from everybody else. You wanna fly, you buy a plane ticket. First-class ticket, way more expensive. Why? There’s less people up there. They won’t tell you that. They’ll be like, “No, you get more space.” It’s like, yeah, motherfucker, space is just the absence of people.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n It’s not a new entity. Space is a euphemism for not anybody. “No, you get all this legroom.” Yeah, ’cause they’re no people in the way of where my legs are trying to go. We could all have legroom back here if we weren’t all back here.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Now, could you imagine if two people in economy class were, like, fighting over the armrest, and some asshole from first class came back and was like, “Hey! We need to all work together. We need to find unity and strength as a flight. We’re all flight 348, after all.” Then they swoosh the curtain and go back to their apartment in the sky. How quickly before the back rows start bundling their plastic silverware together to storm the front?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Like, “No, no, we’re not trying to hijack the plane, we’re just trying to kill rows one through five. Take their hot towels and orange juice and spread it around.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n That’s the fantasy. Everyone fantasizes about what they would do when they get rich. You wanna get away from everybody. Nobody fantasizes about togetherness. Nobody’s like, “Oh, dude, if I got rich… (CHUCKLES) I would get so many roommates.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Oh, it’d be sick, we’d have like a dishes schedule.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n No, the fantasy is, “I’m gonna build a moat around my house. People aren’t gonna be able to ring my doorbell without swimming across a crocodile-laden river.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Fuck everybody. And I got nothing against rich people. You just can’t have it both ways. You can’t bridge class with a speech. You can’t have it all and then have this, like, faux empathy. Like, “Aww… it’s so sad, people don’t have any money.” It’s like, “Well, you seem to have it.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Try giving it away. You don’t have to have it.” And these phony causes, every Thanksgiving, one of them comes out with, like, “It’s so terrible what happened to the Native Americans.” It’s like, “Fucking, I don’t know, give ’em the land back.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) “No.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “We can’t do that. Where would we put the offices of DoorDash?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES) I swear to God, these fucking… Like North America could be, like, falling into the ocean. We could all be killing each other over grain seeds and fresh water. These people would be like on Mars, -tweeting, “Stop the violence.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Love is stronger than hate.” And changing their profile picture to a blue circle to show they still care about Earth.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Going on Jimmy Fallon to promote it, like, “Yeah, we’re changing our profile pictures to blue circles to raise Earth awareness.” Jimmy’s just like, “Oh, my God, it’s genius. Such a good idea.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Oh, my God, how’d you think of it? It’s so important. You’re doing such important work.” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Oh, my God, it’s…” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)\\r\\n (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Jimmy Fallon. I’m sorry, is there a more Guy Smiley, useless, puppet fuck of a person…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)\\r\\n …than Jimmy Fallon? Professional napkin. Like how the fuck?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n (GIGGLES SARCASTICALLY) Dude, I used to think Leno said nothing. Fallon makes Leno look like Malcolm X.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Like, “Oh, yeah.” (BABBLES INCOMPREHENSIBLY) I’ll never get asked to do the show, but…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES) I… I would wanna do it just one time, just to be like, “Hey, Jimmy, what do you not like?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “What… Is there anything… Do you have a hard stance on fucking anything?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n He’d be like, “Oh, my God, it’s such a cool take.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n (GIGGLES) “I don’t know, I… I just kinda float around. I have no discretion, yet I’m hugely influential. Culture’s a joke.” (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Every time I speak, I mean less to myself. I’m murdering my identity up here.” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) “It’s genius.” (LAUGHS) Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Like you could literally… You could put a gun in his mouth and… (MIMICS GUNSHOT) …blow his head off and he’d be like, “Oh, my God, my brains are on the wall! It’s so cool!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “How’d you do that?” He’s a horror movie villain. You can’t kill him. His weapon is just effusive nothingness. He just keeps coming. (SCREECHES) “Come back! Don’t you wanna play truth or dare with Ariana Grande?” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n Nice. (SIGHS) Look, I just think if entertainment is gonna be this ubiquitous, it can’t be this devoid of humanity. It just can’t. It… You know, ’cause I grew up, entertainm',\n","  'ent was important to me. And so, you know, I looked to it for something, and to be that devoid of substance, it feels… insulting. The problem with entertainment is that it’s all made… by the same type of person. It’s made by entertainers. Right? So it’s like…\\r\\n Entertainers are psychotic.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Like, just statistically. So, look at this room right now. Almost everybody in the room is sitting nicely, looking at this, and only one person is like, “Heh, heh, my thoughts.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “My thoughts.” And after this is over, you’ll go home to your respectable lives. And I’ll try to find another place to do, “My thoughts.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Soon I’ll be full.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n So you have to consider the source, right? I think about that with all media. Social media, for example, like, you know… You look at like Twitter or something like that, it’s like… Like Twitter… Who’s on Twitter? It’s just… It’s only people who think it’s like a good idea -to be on Twitter. Like…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s not everybody. It pretends to be everybody, like, “Ooh, everyone’s mad.” You look at the trending topics, “Ooh, what’s everyone talking about?” It’s not. Most people aren’t on it. Eighty percent of the public doesn’t use it. Ninety percent, I think, doesn’t use it regularly. So, like, what’s trending? Like… Most people aren’t there, so what’s really trending is shutting the fuck up. Like, most people…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Most people are doing that, but you can’t register that. You can’t show somebody not tweeting. Like you can’t… They should show how much we don’t tweet also. They should show like a tweet, and then you scroll through blank space for like seven hours.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n And then you come across another tweet. You’d be like, “This is a barren wasteland for lunatics.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Everyone on Twitter is somebody on Twitter. There’s an inherent insanity in the medium. Right? It’s the same reason I can’t trust Yelp.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Every time I look at Yelp, I read a Yelp review, I’m like, “Yeah, but this person wrote a Yelp review.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Why am I listening to a person who logged in to write three paragraphs on broccoli rabe?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Everyone on Yelp is someone on Yel… Every Yelp review starts with someone going, “I’m gonna write a Yelp review.” Like, fuck whoever that person is. But that’s everyone on Yelp. Everyone on Yelp is someone who uses Yelp. Everyone on Twitter is someone who uses Twitter. I want a social media site where the only way to use it is to not. Like, I don’t wanna hear the thoughts that you want me to think that you think. I wanna hear what you think. I wanna hear what you don’t even let yourself think you think. You know those thoughts? You ever have like a fucking crazy thought that bubbles up, and you push it away, you’re like, “Didn’t think it! Didn’t think it. Still a good person. Didn’t… ‘Cause I didn’t think it all the way. I didn’t finish the thought that I clearly started, so somehow that’s not me.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n I want those. I want you to cut open your heart and dump it into my brain. Intimacy is what I’m looking for. Which is not… I shouldn’t go to social media for intimacy, you can’t get it. You ever see someone try to be intimate on social media? -It’s fucking terrible.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It doesn’t work. It never works, ’cause it doesn’t have the language for intimacy. ‘Cause intimacy is amorphous. It doesn’t come with a character limit, or a soundtrack, or filter, it’s just… (GRUNTS) The language of social media, is like, snark and division and attacks and clapbacks and, “Oh, that? Oh, clearly you don’t even know about this.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n That rises. That gets a lot of attention. But we’re all, like, fucked up, right? It’s like very confusing, and there’s a big market right now for certainty. Anyone who has an answer, even if it’s the wrong one, is in demand. That’s why you get this whole rash of people who garner these followings, ’cause they’re giving people a narrative. All these like, you know, podcast hosts, demagogue type, usually a white dude who’s like, “Hey, the media and the government are all lying to you, but you know who’s not?” (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) “Me!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Me, the guy trying to sell you CBD oil and sex toys every 30 minutes. I’m your beacon of truth. Wear me, listen to me.” This is collective narcissism. It’s changed the way we think, like the way we process our own language, like how we sound. I remember in the ’16 election, they were talking about the Rock maybe running for president, and I said that to a friend, I was like, “Yo, I heard the Rock might run for president.” My buddy was like, “Is the Rock a Democrat?” And I was like, “Dude, listen to the sentence…”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “…that you just said. Is the Rock a Democrat? I don’t know. He’s a fake wrestling character. I don’t know where he stands on healthcare.” Is the Rock a Democrat? I don’t know. Did the Yellow Power Ranger support the war in Iraq? What the fuck are we talking about?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING,',\n","  ' APPLAUDING)\\r\\n Where does Mickey Mouse stand on abortion? I don’t know. Is he a “second trimester or before” kind of mouse, or more like a hardline… (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) “Life begins at conception, folks.” Like, I don’t know what Mickey thinks. Does Mickey think, or does he just do whatever the artist makes him do? Is there a consciousness in Mickey? Do any of us think, or are we just being guided by an unseen hand? Is thinking part of the illusion? Is Descartes a fraud? This is why I had to get off of Twitter. I existentially spiral. I lose who I am. I did, I deleted my Twitter a year ago. I still have Instagram because I’m stupid.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Instagram is… It’s like hell. It’s just like hell. You can download hell to your phone for free.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n It’s free. Hell is free. Instagram is just like, “Hey… uh, are you not feeling jealous today?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Come hang out. Look, there’s a beer, some food you’ll never eat. Go fuck yourself. We hate you. We are trying to tear you down. We don’t give a fuck. Here’s places you’ll never go. Here’s a person that will never fuck you. Go fuck yourself. We hate you.” “We are manipulating your emotions, and then monitoring them so we can sell you shit. You want a bracelet? Yeah, we knew you would, motherfucker.” Literally. Literally! Literally. People are like, “What do those bracelets mean?” They mean I’m a fucking moron!\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n They mean I was depressed and got a targeted ad and thought these bracelets would turn it all around.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n That’s what they mean. “You are nothing. We have hollowed you out and emptied you and filled you with ourselves and the desire for more. You are powerless against it. This is a takeover. Didn’t happen the way it did in Terminator. It’s a lot more subtle, with more cat videos and 14-year-olds twerking. Is that a crime? Ha, ha. We’ll never tell you.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n I hate it. It makes me feel like shit. The only social media site that I like… is, uh, Venmo.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n That’s right. I like Venmo. Venmo’s a money transfer app, which everybody knows. But what not everybody knows is that on Venmo, there’s a feed, where you can like… tab over and you can see all of your friends’ and your contacts’ financial transactions, which should be illegal, but it’s there.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n It’s right there. And I like it because it’s honest. It’s the only honest social media site out there. Every other social media site is a projection of a version of yourself that you wish you were onto a canvas. Not Venmo. Venmo is the honest antidote to the horseshit of Instagram. Instagram makes you feel bad because you’re aware of your own fears and insecurities and preoccupations, but you’re not seeing anybody else’s. So you’re always gonna lean that way. So you see a picture on Instagram of, like, a couple…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Maybe they’re on, like, a beach… looking at a gorgeous sunset. Maybe they’re eating a pizza.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n You look at this, you’re like, “What the fuck? What the fuck? The fuck is wrong with me? How come I’m not doing that shit, huh? Is there something wrong with me? Is there a hole here that everybody can see? Do I emanate darkness, do I repel love? Is there a limit to my emotional aptitude? Did my father’s genetics set that limit? Do I need to go back on antidepressants? What the fuck is going on inside of me that’s not leading me to that type of bliss? What do I have to do to get there?” But then you look at Venmo and it’s like, “Oh, no, dude, they split that pizza.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHEERING)\\r\\n (APPLAUSE)\\r\\n “I’m doing just fine.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “I don’t need medication.” (CHUCKLES) It’s not a referendum on splitting stuff in a relationship. I think if you’re gonna split stuff, just don’t split the items. Go every other. Does that make sense? I’ll see that on Venmo. I go on Venmo, I’ll see, “Boyfriend sends girlfriend money for tacos.” I’m just, like, how the fuck do you go down on someone after you just sent them eight bucks?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n (SCOFFS) “You’re just bitter, Drew, that you have no one to split stuff with.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Yeah, I’m single. I’m 36… and single. I’m single and 36, which is fine. Uh, but it is almost not.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Like, it’s not bad yet, but bad is next.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Bad is the next stop on this… train. A lot of my friends are married. And it’s cool to see. A lot of them are in, like, really great relationships, really healthy, good, loving relationships. And it’s really amazing to see. I go to their weddings, I really enjoy it. Seeing them come together, it’s a beautiful thing. And I hear a lot of the same things in the vows. There’s a common refrain in the vows, which is something about, like, you know, “I get to marry my best friend.” “I’m so lucky to have found my best friend.” “I never thought I would spend the rest of my life with my best friend.” And I hear that, I’m like, “That’s such a beautiful sentiment.” Like, the person you marry should feel… like your best friend. I’m in the back, I’m like, “We',\n","  'll, I’m 36, so who the fuck meets their best friend in their late thirties?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Who’s out there like, “This is my best friend! We met when were 38!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Tell him, Doug!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n No, it doesn’t happen. They’re all having kids, too, starting families. My friends starting families, it’s beautiful to see. I don’t have my own family. I have, like, a family from which I’ve come. I don’t have…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n …the next line on that. Like on a family tree, I’m just a node that ends.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s just like, “Who’s that?” “That’s your great Uncle Drew, nobody loved him.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Just a leaf on a twig. Just a Styrofoam ball with no toothpicks, if we’re using school project lingo.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Oh, cool, you got me a PlayStation for my birthday. I love you, Dad.” I just beat God of War for the fourth time.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE MEMBER CHEERING)\\r\\n It’s a good game.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s not “hugging my smiling child” good.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGH)\\r\\n But the gameplay mechanics are pretty tight.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n I think part of the reason I don’t… have a family, well, at least what I used to tell myself, is that I do this. It’s something that I chose. I chose a different path. I remember I started doing stand-up when I was 22. I dropped out of school, and… at the time, my mother warned me. She said, “You know, it’s not very stable. You’re gonna be living hand-to-mouth, traveling a lot. You’re not gonna be able to settle down.” And she was right to an extent. But the problem was, she was telling this to a 22-year-old dude. Like the least likely candidate on Earth to settle down. I don’t know if you know any 22-year-old dudes, but they’re not technically people.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Just unprocessed pain and skin. Like, that’s pretty much the identity there. So, 22, I’m hearing this, I’m like, “Settle down? What are you, a hundred? I don’t give a fuck. I’m going on the road, Mom. I’ma follow my dreams! Nobody is gonna stop me!” That was my attitude. Now I’m 36. Now I see the punchline. Now it’s like… (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) “Nobody is going to hug me as I die.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) Is that funny? I don’t know. I structured it as a joke. Does that make it funny? I don’t know. Does comedy have the ability to transform the emotional constitution of reality, or is it just adding a layer to an unfortunate event? I don’t know how the physics of comedy work. I used to tell myself that it was a sacrifice I was making. I was leaving that on the side to pursue this. And I used to look… It was very easy to make that argument, ’cause I used to look around and there were a lot of men who accomplished things that I considered to be great, whose personal life was kind of left by the wayside. And so it seemed to me as a necessary component. I remember in high school I learned about Isaac Newton. And Isaac Newton invented calculus. He also died a virgin.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Which begs the question, can you invent calculus while fucking people?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n I don’t know. It’s never been done.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n A more modern example, Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs was an incredible innovator… uh, terrible father… right, which we know, it’s documented, but we also just knew.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n We knew. Every time we’d go into our pocket, if Steve Jobs were a good dad, we’d pull out a Samsung or a Motorola.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Every time you text someone and it shows up blue, that’s Steve Jobs not going to a piano recital -or a softball game.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n And I don’t think we have the right to judge him. Like, we are all glad he did it. Like, we encouraged that. As a society, we would all rather one girl grow up with a shitty dad than have to all of us use Windows. Are you out of your fucking mind? You want us all to click a Start button and run clunky .exe files just so one girl can open her gifts next to the guy who paid for them? Fuck that! She can get them from a nanny while the rest of us enjoy our… technological ecosystem seamlessly integrated.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n That’s what we encourage. We encourage it. True happiness has no societal value. We want productivity. Give us… Make something or shut up! Like, we don’t care. So there’s this incentive to do it. And it gets even more fucked up. Someone like Michael Jackson, who was this incredible popstar and a horrendous babysitter, you know, where it’s just like…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Yeah, it’s an easy one, but it’s fun. It’s fun, though. It’s so easy, but it’s so fun.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n No, but even that, like there’s such an instinct to defend these guys. Like my first instinct is to be like… see it from their side, because I think we’re such… we’re conditioned to like them on that level. So even with Michael, I was like… you know, there was a part of me… I watched that documentary about him, I was like, “Oh, that’s fucked up.” But there was a part of me that was like, “Yeah, but if not an eight-year-old boy, who was Michael Jackson supposed to date?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE ',\n","  'CHUCKLING)\\r\\n You know what I mean? What is he looking at, options-wise, that makes any sense at all? Somebody his age? He did that. He was married to Lisa Marie Presley, a grown woman, and that was weirder somehow.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n That was weirder. They made out on television. It was fucking weird. There was like an awards show presentation and at the end, they like did this kiss, it was just awful. Like, “Oh!” The whole world was just like, “Oh, my God.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Jesus, will somebody get this guy a kid?” -Like, “This is horrible.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Because Michael Jackson with a kid, it upsets us morally, but it looks right.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Michael can’t date an adult. You wouldn’t set your friend up with him. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Who’s he supposed to… What is he gonna do, go on like a blind date with a 35-year-old software developer? How’s that gonna go? “Hey, nice to meet you, Michael.” He’s like, “You wanna play tag? You’re it.” Like, come on.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Where are your…” “Tag? I thought we’d go to dinner.” “Dinner’s for dumb-dumbs. We can eat candy at my house and stay up as late as we want. Tee-hee!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Michael can’t date an adult. I don’t even know what kind of adult would be into Michael. Like you wanna… you wanna fuck him? Listen to him sure, but, like, you wanna…\\r\\n (IMITATES MICHAEL JACKSON) You wanna fuck that guy?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n You wanna fuck him? “Here, doo-doo head.” You’re gonna fuck him? Dude, if you’re an adult and you wanna fuck Michael Jackson… you’re a pedophile.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n But you look at all these guys, you know, Michael Jackson, Isaac Newton, Steve Jobs, they were adored by the world but hated by the people closest to them. And I would imagine that you’d tell yourself that that’s a sacrifice… that you make, but… as I get older, I look at it differently. I don’t know if I look at it as a sacrifice anymore. Maybe… maybe not. Maybe… they just ran from responsibility into the arms of ambition. You know, maybe Apple and Pixar… are just built off the back of one man’s inability to be intimate with the people closest to him. Or with himself. And so it recasts my own path, where I’m like, maybe this isn’t a sacrifice. I’m not comparing myself to… Steve Jobs and… Isaac Newton, you know. It’s a matter of scale.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n But even in the comedy world, even the people that I looked up to… When I started, all the people that I looked up to, they’re all either, like, prematurely dead, utterly miserable, or, like, sex criminals. So… where is this headed?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Where is this path going? Their greatness is predicated on their accomplishments, but we fail to recognize how they failed in their private moments. And I think that’s a masculine definition of greatness. Because, like, I don’t look at that as great anymore because they couldn’t confront who they were as a person. They couldn’t confront the emotional reality of their experience. That is greatness to me. To do that, that is a much greater thing. How great can something be if it’s built on avoidance? I think you have to… confront. And it’s scary. It’s a scary fucking thing to do. Like, I get it. It’s like totally scary for a lot of reasons. One, you can find out that the story you’ve been telling yourself about yourself isn’t true. You can find out that what you thought was like the harsh, brutal reality of yourself, you’re just resting on an easier narrative that could be subverted by something else. Like I used to tell myself stories about myself that have shifted over time. I used to tell myself this was a sacrifice. I used to tell myself that what I was doing up here was important, that it was fearless. That I was fearless for doing this. I had the balls to say shit that nobody else did. Things like that Michael Jackson joke, I’d be like, “That’s fearless. That’s a fearless fucking thing. You can get mad at me. That’s fearless. I’m willing to stand that down.” But as I get older, I’m like, “That’s not… I think it’s funny, but it’s not fearless.” Because my emotional experience is nowhere in there. I’m nowhere in that joke. I wasn’t molested, and I’m not a pedophile.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n That would be fearless.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n The most fearless pedophile joke you could tell is to be one and admit it publicly.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n No, worst-case scenario, worst-case scenario, the joke bombs and you don’t like it. You look at me, arms folded, shaking your head and say, “No.” Fortunately, that didn’t happen this evening, but it has happened. It could happen. You can get mad. You could think I suck. You could not like me. But, counterpoint… who are you?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n I can barely see any of you, and I love none of you. So what is this power… that you hold over me? You’re not me. We are always our most terrifying audience. I believe that. That’s why it’s so funny when people say that, like, public speaking is the number one fear of people. They say, you hear that, “Public speaking is the number one fear of people.” It’s like, “Well, I’m sorry, was conf',\n","  'ronting yourself on an emotional level not on that questionnaire?” The fuck you talking about, public speaking? I’m public speaking right now. It’s fine. I’m public speaking as a way to avoid confronting myself on an emotional level.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n This is all. Like, up here it’s, like, “Dopamine!” And if I were at home, it’d be like… (SCREECHES) (SCREECHES) I have used this to avoid so many… I can’t tell you how many relationships I’ve been in where I’ve been like, “Oh, sorry, I can’t hang out with you tonight. I have to go do a show.” Or more specifically, “Sorry, I can’t be there on your birthday. I need to go do this bit about how all my relationships fall apart.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s like just, “Do I need any of this?” And I think as men, we have this tendency to wanna process everything in our lives through, you know, intellect, or logic, or our thoughts, or our reason, things that we do, things that are tactile, and it’s like… you’re ignoring the entire emotional subset of your experience. And this idea that logic and emotions are separate, they’re not. Like your thoughts are not separate from how you feel. Your thoughts… Thoughts are just emotions in drag.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s the same ecosystem. It’s hard to dive in… like that. Therapy’s a good way to do it. I think people… a lot of people need… They’re men… all men.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Yeah, I’m comfortable saying that. All men need to go to therapy for… 20 years. Like…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n Roughly. (CHUCKLES) Sometimes guys get mad. They’re like, “Fuck you, I don’t need shit, you pandering pussy.” It’s like, “Hey. You do.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “What was that?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Women need therapy too. But usually when a woman goes to therapy, it’s because a man in her life didn’t.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n I started going four times a week. It’s a program, it’s called psychoanalysis, and it’s, uh… The reason you go so often is so that you don’t have time to close up. Like, if you go once a week, you have all week to just close back up, so you stay open throughout the week so you can access parts of yourself that are much harder to access normally. And so it’s very emotional. It’s very exhausting. It’s very trying. I cry a lot. I sob… The other day, I sobbed for, like, 20 minutes straight. And this is how fucked up I am. As soon as I collected myself, my first thought was, “That shouldn’t count toward my time.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) But that’s me trying to get out of that moment. Like that moment was hard to swallow, and so… joke, out, now we’re out of it. But I don’t think that’s how progress gets made. I think if you wanna make progress, you can’t take that left turn at a punchline. You have to go… You have to sit there and process it there. You have to go down. You have to take that Miss Frizzle Magic School Bus all the way. “We’re going to your emotional core!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Look out your left window. Is that Mom going on a date instead of hanging out with you? Yes, it is.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Process it! Feel it!” You have to stay there, and leave it there. You can’t buy yourself out of the moment. Otherwise, the progress won’t get made. It’s very hard to do. And I’m up here and I, like, I want to bring you in. Like, that’s where this is going. Like I want… That’s the next step, is I want to bring you all to that place. But it’s hard because, like, I don’t know if there’s a show down there. But I wanna bring you in, but I feel conflicted. I feel like I can’t… I have to like… I feel like that’s how this works, is I go in, I mine my own life for sadness, and then I contort it into a balloon animal for you so you don’t feel ripped off.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n I tried… to do that. I wrote… I wrote a joke… that tries to do that.\\r\\n Why did the chicken…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n …cross the road?\\r\\n AUDIENCE: Why?\\r\\n Because… he grew up… with an untreated hearing loss… which deprived him of a major sensory connection to the people around him, and it isolated him to the point of chronic torture. And his parents were too caught up in their own drama and insecurities to attend to it, so he processed it as though there was something inherently wrong with him. And his feelings are a threat to his relationships, so he just suffered in silence, feeling like he was 100 feet underwater, wondering why nobody was coming to save him. And then, he finally started wearing hearing aids, which created this insane sensation of being able to participate in a world that he didn’t understand. But because his self-worth was predicated on how special he felt, he realized that the trodden path didn’t appeal to him. So he would get high and watch stand-up comedy as a way to numb the agony of how lost he felt. And in doing so, he found a lot of connection with their points of view, and he thought, “Wow, if I could do that, people could connect to me like that.” So he decided to drop out of school and pursue stand-up comedy, and doing comedy made him feel better for a moment, but it never forced him to address any of the reasons he actually felt like sh',\n","  'it. He so badly wanted to feel special and powerful to make up for how worthless he felt, so he would say all sorts of fucked-up things, onstage and off, as a way to separate himself. And a lot of it he stands by, but there are a lot of things he said that were flagrant and unnecessary and hurtful and racist and sexist and homophobic, all of which he justified under the guise of pushing the envelope, which he thought was an act of justified rebellion against some arbitrary authority. But too late, he learned that a lot of those boundaries are derived from real people’s feelings and experiences and he was essentially exploiting their actual pain and using it as a traffic cone to satisfy this story he was telling himself where he was a genius. And just because people laugh at something doesn’t inherently make it good. They could be just as emotionally immature or ignorant as the perspective in the joke, or they could be responding to joke structure and timing more than content. And then, one day…\\r\\n (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)\\r\\n …all the world’s stages boarded up, so he sat alone in a room for a year, and he did nothing but talk to the walls and a therapist. And with no emotion to escape into, he slowly started breaking down the paradigm he’d constructed and moved into the feelings he was running from. And he discovered how badly he had been hurting his entire life, and what it actually is to hurt so badly. And he realized that there was not a single period of his life in which he was truly happy. And through that, he started to realize how much pain he had caused other people. He instantly regretted all the ways in which he’s needlessly made people feel like shit in order to protect his own conception of himself as strong. Then he wanted to disappear from the world entirely because he felt like such an incredibly bad person for having done these things. So his instinct was to beat himself up about it and tell himself what a horrible person he is, but he’s been shaming himself his entire life, and all these things he did were just ways to push people away and deprive himself of any meaningful connection, because of how badly he felt about himself, because it was too scary and painful to be open enough to connect to anyone else. So, while he hurt people, he was hurting no one more than himself, and he doesn’t want to do that anymore. He has worked so hard to clear out space within himself and feel safer in his own body and treat himself like a friend he loves as opposed to an enemy he hates, which means he no longer tolerates dynamics based on his own self-destruction, which has changed numerous relationships in his life, including the one with the art form that he loves. The fear has always been that if he makes peace with the subterranean feelings that drive all of this, he’d lose this piece of himself which has helped him survive and get to this point, a fear that he won’t be funny anymore, he won’t be special, he’ll just be, which has been an intolerable notion because he doesn’t feel like enough on his own. He’s only known how to exist by chasing, or thinking, or running, or fighting, or straining, or suffering, or striving, or analyzing, anxious energy which ultimately manifests the very same emptiness it’s borne out of. And it keeps him locked into one side of himself, but he’s making every effort to find a way to not give in to those anxieties and sit with the quiet inside of himself because he wants so badly to get to the other side.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)\\r\\n Thank you very much.\\r\\n (APPLAUSE CONTINUES)\\r\\n Thank you.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHEERING)\\r\\n (MELANCHOLY MUSIC CONTINUES)\\r\\n (“CARNIVAL” BY COREY LAITMAN PLAYING)\\r\\n Well, I know\\r\\n It’s all you can do\\r\\n To put one foot\\r\\n In front of the other\\r\\n When the cold has got\\r\\n Your bones\\r\\n And there’s a virus\\r\\n Hiding out in your brain\\r\\n So if you’ve got to carve out\\r\\n Your sterile spaces\\r\\n And hide out inside\\r\\n Those high up places\\r\\n In the name of staying safe\\r\\n And keeping sane\\r\\n In this wind and this rain\\r\\n Oh Funny thing, I’ve been\\r\\n Watching you charm the crowd\\r\\n They’re laying down\\r\\n Their arms\\r\\n Oh\\r\\n They’re clapping out loud\\r\\n Oh, but funny thing\\r\\n You’ve grown so small\\r\\n It’s hard to see you\\r\\n There at all\\r\\n Well, I know It’s all you can do\\r\\n To put one foot\\r\\n In front of the other\\r\\n When the cold has got\\r\\n Your bones\\r\\n And there’s a virus\\r\\n Hiding out in your brain\\r\\n Oh\\r\\n So if you’ve got to carve out\\r\\n Your sterile spaces\\r\\n And hide out inside\\r\\n Those high up places\\r\\n In the name of staying safe\\r\\n And keeping sane\\r\\n In this wind and this rain\\r\\n Oh\\r\\n (MUSIC CONCLUDES)\\r\\n Your email address will not be published.

That almost makes me forget we’re all gonna be dead in a week. I’m kidding. It’ll probably be a month.\\r\\n Remember when we thought the pandemic was over? Everyone was so happy. “We did it!” We probably looked so stupid. Everyone was patting themselves on the back. “You know, I’m just glad I could help out the sick, by staying inside.” “It’s not over? Well, I’m not going back in.” “Those sick people have to die.” ‘Cause it’s not over. The pandemic is like a TV show you thought was canceled, and then it got picked up by Netflix. Oh… I didn’t really pace myself for another season.\\r\\n I don’t know about you, I wasn’t planning on seeing my family ever again. Parents know the feeling. It’s like changing that diaper in the middle of the night. You’re exhausted. It’s disgusting. But you have to do it. So you change the diaper, you finally get the sleeper back on, and as you gently lay the baby back in the crib, you hear the diaper fill up again. And that’s what the year 2021 is. Over and over. It’s just a diaper filling up over and over.\\r\\n I kind of miss the early days of the pandemic. Those were fun. Back when we thought washing our hands would protect us. “Everyone, wash your hands. We’ll be fine.” “Okay.” Remember before there were readily available tests, everyone had that friend that used to brag “Yeah, I already had COVID.” “I had it back in ’91.” “Yeah. Back then, it was called COVID-91.” “Had it a couple times. Got rid of it by washing my hands.”\\r\\n ‘Cause the symptoms were confusing. They’re still confusing. It’s like, “What are the symptoms?” “Everything.” “What do you mean, everything?” “Asking a question is a symptom.” “Well, that can’t be true.” “Denial is a major symptom.” Did you wipe down your groceries? I did that. It felt so silly. You know, like, “I’m just a normal guy cleaning a Triscuit box.” “Is this what OCD feels like?” Couple weeks later, you’re like, “Nah, they look clean to me.” “I cleaned ’em.”\\r\\n But you had to take the precautions. There was no uniformity. Everyone talked a big game, right? “Oh, we’re on lockdown.” “No work, no school, you know.” “We got our bubble.” “Bubble’s just my family and these two people we see at a weekly sex party.” “I figured, better safe than sorry.”\\r\\n ‘Cause we all went through the same pandemic, but we didn’t have the same experience, right? There were factors. Like, if you were 25 and healthy, you’re like, “Whatever. I’m going on a COVID cruise.” But if you were over the age of 25… And it may surprise you, but I am… …you watched the news more closely, right? The news guys would be like, “High-risk people are older.” You’re like, “Well, how old?” “Like old old, or didn’t-have-a-cellphone-in-high-school old?” Right? ‘Cause nobody thinks of themselves as old.\\r\\n The reality of your age just occasionally slaps you across the face. I did this benefit for a hospital. It was a fancy event. When I showed up, the woman running the event was like, “Oh, my gosh. We went to the same college.” She was younger, but we talked and we realized we hung out at the same places. At the end of the event, I was leaving and she ran up to me, she was like, “I need to know what year you graduated college.” I was like, “1988.” And she was like, “Oh, my gosh. That’s the year I was born.” Slap! Right across the face. I didn’t even know what to say. I was like, “Ah, that’s the year I was born too.” She looked at me like, “That’s not funny.” And then I got in my car and stuffed food in my mouth until I stopped feeling anything.\\r\\n Sometimes you had to decipher the news. Right? The newscaster would be like, “The vulnerable are older and people with comorbidities.” You’re like, “Co what?” “Comorbidity.” Which eventually we figured out was just code for, “All the fat asses are gonna die.” But they couldn’t say that on the news. They couldn’t have Sanjay Gupta be like, “Well, Anderson, all the fat asses are gonna die.” So they said comorbidities. And at home, we were like, “Honey, what is a comorb…” “I don’t know. Pass the gravy.” In time, we figured out they were talking about fat people. And if you were overweight, you were like, “How fat?” Or like, “Are we talking Walmart fat or Jim Gaffigan fat?”\\r\\n I got the message. I dunno, I totally got the message. I started working out. I started eating healthy. I was going good. Then one day I looked in the mirror and I was like, “Ah, enough of that.” Turns out, life or death, not the motivator you’d think it would be. “You could live longer.” “Not a good enough reason.” “Can you sweeten the deal, maybe throw in a pizza?” I tried. I tried.\\r\\n My wife bought me a scale, so the romance is still alive. I didn’t ask for it. She gave it to me as a gift. I could never do something like that. “Happy birthday, honey. I bought you a scale and some makeup.” “Just lookin’ out for you, sweetie.” It’s a high-tech scale. Comes with an app so the government can know how overweight I am. I don’t know w',\n","  'hy there’s an app. Maybe so I can be the victim of Ransomware. “Pay up or we’re telling everyone how fat you are.” “But I don’t have any crypto currency.” I set up the app, stood on the scale, my weight showed up on the phone, 150 pounds. All right, it was over 200. All right, it was way over 200. If it was an old-fashioned scale, you wouldn’t see the number 200. But it was in the 200 family. And underneath my weight, on the phone, there was this word in small red lettering. I didn’t have my glasses on so I asked my daughter. I was like, “What does that say?” She was like, “Obese.” Slap! Right across the face. I just looked at my daughter, I’m like, “Ah, I gotta update this app.” And then I ran to the kitchen and stuffed food in my mouth till I stopped feeling anything.\\r\\n Still wearing masks. There was that time when nobody had to wear a mask, right? That was a fun day. Remember the first time you went out in public without a mask? It was weird, right? You felt naked. You were like, “Oh, I’m so European.” “What is this, the French Riviera?” I was kind of tempted to wear, like, a thong mask. You know, something tasteful yet naughty. “I can see his cheeks, but there’s still a mystery.” “Ooh-la-la.”\\r\\n ♪ Round and pale and mostly balding ♪\\r\\n ♪ The boy from Indiana goes walking ♪\\r\\n ♪ And as he does All the people he pass go ♪\\r\\n ♪ “Yuck!” ♪\\r\\n Initially, it was strange seeing other people’s faces without a mask. You wanted to go up to some people like, “You should stick with the mask.” “It’s a better look for you. You in a mask is better for everyone.” Did you meet anyone during the pandemic where you only knew them with a mask? And then when you finally saw them barefaced, you’re like, “Yikes.” You felt like you were catfished. You’re like, “Wow, your face doesn’t match your voice at all.” “And who stole your chin?”\\r\\n Of course, the biggest reveal of the pandemic was how many crazy people there are. That was a bit of a surprise. We all knew there were some Unabombers out there, but, nobody thought there were that many. Or that we were related to a couple of them. You know? ‘Cause everyone had that relative or friend that came out as bonkers. “I no longer believe in reality.” “Good to know.” It was like a gender reveal for insanity. “The truth is no longer true.” “See you at Thanksgiving.”\\r\\n I feel like it happened for me more often ’cause I’ve always had friends that are eccentric thinkers and they’re normally really entertaining. They’re like, “Bigfoot’s real, man. Bigfoot is real.” But that same person, at one point during the pandemic, was like, “Tom Hanks eats babies.” “Don’t say that.” “Tom Hanks does eat babies.” “And if you don’t believe that, then you eat babies.” “All right.” “Tom Hanks eats babies.” “He always seemed like a baby-eater to me.”\\r\\n The thing I missed most during the lockdown was restaurants. I know that’s a surprise. I didn’t even realize how much I missed restaurants ’til the first time I went out to eat and I caught myself catcalling other people’s food. “Oh, yeah.” “What I would do to you.” “Get me a fork and knife.” “Jim, you’re in public.” “Oh, sorry.”\\r\\n This is gonna kind of sound pandering, but I believe the pandemic has been hardest on mothers. Definitely hardest on mothers. Right? Or the men who had to live with those mothers. It was insane for… I don’t know how my wife did it.\\r\\n We had five children doing distance-learning. And my kids were good. They totally kept a distance from learning. We asked children to do school on the same device they play Minecraft. It’s like holding a Weight Watchers meeting in a Wendy’s. I mean, it was insane. I definitely gained an appreciation for how difficult it is to be a teacher. And what a poor career choice that was. Right?\\r\\n I guess it was, uh, after the first case of Scotch, I turned to my wife… …and I said, “When this is over, if there’s even an opening, I’ll take you wherever you wanna go. Wherever you wanna go.” My wife was like, “I want to go to Hawaii.” And I was like, “I was thinking more Tri-State area.” She was like, “I wanna go to Hawaii and I wanna bring the kids.” And I was like, “Whose kids?” She was like, “Our kids.” I did the research, saw that it was cheaper than a divorce, so we went to Hawaii. And… Hawaii is such a special place. It really is. It’s like there’s the “Aloha Spirit”, where people greet each other with “Aloha,” but I’m so awkward, so they’ll be like, “Aloha,” and I’ll be like, “Hello ha.” Does that mean something? That means…\\r\\n Even when I would use the Hawaiian terms properly, it would backfire. Like if I said, “Mahalo,” the natives would look at me like, “You don’t have to do that.” “Just nod your head and we’ll bring you pork.”\\r\\n ‘Cause I stuck out in Hawaii. I didn’t even look like a tourist. I looked like someone they brought in to make the tourists feel more comfortable. “You’re fine. You wanna see awkward, look at Jim Gaffigan.”\\r\\n Hawaii, it’s incomparable to any other state. It’s a tropical paradise. It’s almost like Hawaii was this Polynesian island nation that we jus',\n","  't took over. You know what I mean? Like, it wasn’t even part of the United States. We just went in like it was an open house. “Nice. Nice.” “We could do our honeymoon here. We’ll take it.” The Hawaiians were like, “We’re our own country.” “That’s cute. I love your flower shirt. Gotta get one of them.” And Hawaiians will tell you, they’ll come right up to you. They’ll be, “You stole this land.” And I’m like, “Don’t know how to break it to you, but we stole all the land.” “Probably just stings a little more ’cause it’s pretty here.” “Believe me, there’s people in Detroit pissed at us.”\\r\\n My wife chose Hawaii because my wife loves the beach. And as you can see, so do I. I spent the entire time applying and re-applying sunscreen which, thankfully, makes my skin whiter. What cruel bastard decided that the goo that protects pale people from the sun should also make them look like White Walkers? It’s… it’s just cruel. They should offer other colors. “Cool. There’s one of the guys from Blue Man Group.” I don’t even know why sunscreen is white. What was the thinking? “Well, you know, those pale people love ranch dressing, so…” “…let’s keep it in their wheelhouse.” ‘Cause I don’t tan. I don’t kind of tan. There’s no medium rare for me. I either look like I’ve never been outside, or I was just released from a burn unit. There’s no in-between.\\r\\n And I know people go to the beach to relax. People find the beach very relaxing. Not so much for me. It’s like being allergic to bees and then, for vacation, becoming a beekeeper. My one goal was to just not burn. I didn’t want to be the sunburned adult. You see a kid with a sunburn, you’re like, “Parenting is hard.” You see an adult with a sunburn, you’re like, “That’s an alcoholic.” Right? ‘Cause… A sunburn on an adult is like a scarlet letter for poor judgment. There is no excuse. “Well, I was caught off-guard this time.” “I didn’t know the fireball in the sky would be hot this time.”\\r\\n When we weren’t at the beach, we did activities. I went zip-lining for the last time. What is wrong with us? “Hey, you wanna feel like you’re about to die?” “Would you pay 200 dollars to feel like you’re about to die six times?” Why don’t you just walk into traffic? “Did you see that bus almost hit me? I feel so alive.” Why don’t you just take off your mask at a biker rally? You know? If you’ve been zip-lining, you know to slow down, you have to spread out your arms and legs. That supposedly slows you down. It also makes it look like a suicide. “Oh, if he didn’t wanna die, why was he doing the chalk outline?” It’s such a weird… How did they even come up with zip-lining? “Hey, you know how telephone poles have a wire between ’em?” “What if we just put the tourists up there?” “Why would tourists do that?” “Don’t know. Why would they pay to swim with sharks?”\\r\\n We did go snorkeling. I wasn’t worried for myself ’cause I figured sharks would look at my legs and be like, “Those can’t be real.” “I’m not gonna bite into another mannequin, that’s for sure.”\\r\\n Sometimes, when my family would go to the beach, I’d go for a hike by myself, which was boring, but I figured how to make it fun. I started bringing a ketchup packet, and halfway through the hike, I’d open up the ketchup packet and rub it on my hands and my face, then I’d just approach romantic couples. “Have you seen my wife?” “No.” “But you heard her sassing off to me, right?” “I can still smell her sin.” “Jim, that joke’s scary.” “That’s a scary joke.”\\r\\n The pandemic continues, but we’re… we’re also processing part of the pandemic. We went a year and a half with no weddings, no kids’ birthday parties, no family reunions, but it wasn’t all good news. Right? Right? Huh? Some things… I don’t think some things are coming back. Like parades. I think that might be a wrap on parades. There was never anything that impressive about a parade. You’re all like, “Hey, kids, look. People are… walking.” “Creating unnecessary traffic.” Before the pandemic, if you ran into a parade, you were never like, “Oh, cool, a parade.” You were always kind of like, “I hate humans.” The only people really enjoying the parade were the people marching in the parade. Even the people on the sidewalk were like, “How long is this?” Of course, the highlight of most parades is the marching band, right? And on TV, that bird’s-eye view of the marching band is so impressive, right? But on a street level, you always felt like you were being invaded by nerds. “Uh-oh. Here they come. Hide your Xbox.”\\r\\n But marching bands are amazing, right? They practice as much as the athletes. They’re always rehearsing. It’s amazing how much effort goes into creating something that no one really likes. I’m kidding. I know there’s some marching band people here and it… And then for those… You know, like… The reality is, a marching band can take a song… It’s pretty impressive… any song, and ruin it. You know, like, “Wow, I didn’t know I could hate ‘Uptown Funk’ that much.” You’re never listening to a song and think, “I wish there was a marching band version of this.',\n","  \"” And I understand there’s some proud marching band people here. And in full disclosure, I could never be in a marching band ’cause I’ve had sex. “He’s… He’s gonna get beat up by a marching band.” No, I know that people cherish their time in the marching band, they do. But to me, it just seems like we’re dissuading careers in music. It’s like, “Oh, you wanna be a musician? Okay.” “Put on this Captain Crunch costume.” “At halftime, march around the field while we grab some hot dogs.” “Do that for a couple semesters, then we’ll see if you still wanna be a musician.”\\r\\n Did you know that…? I didn’t know this. Marching bands started as military bands. They would march armies into battle, and they were for morale and to intimidate the enemy. I don’t know how that would work. “Oh, no. They know Fleetwood Mac.” “Should we go back?” “What if Lindsey Buckingham is with them?” How did they convince someone playing a trumpet to march into battle… “Head on in there.” “Won’t they have weapons?” “You’re gonna fight them with music.” “If you survive, please wake us up in the morning with a…” I love it when trumpet players have the plunger at the end. Who came up with that? “You know, I was listening to you play the trumpet and it reminded me of when I clogged my toilet.” “I’d eaten six Big Macs on a dare, anyway.” “Uh, I brought my plunger. It’s kind of clean.” “If you could place it at the end of your expensive music equipment, and give me a ‘wah-wah.'” “Go ahead.” “Have you ever thought of becoming a plumber?”\\r\\n It’s ridiculous. People always know someone who looks like me. Wherever I go, once a week, someone will come up to me and go, “Hey, I know someone that looks like you.” I never know what to say. “Well, tell him ‘Hi.'” “Encourage them to wear sunscreen.” And this person who looks like me never doing something impressive with their life. “Yeah, he mows our lawn.” “We don’t even pay him. He just does it.” That sounds like my gene pool. Occasionally, on social media, I’ll be sent photos of babies who supposedly look like me. “This baby looks like Jim Gaffigan.” People think it’s hysterical that I look like a pale, pudgy, bald infant who poops in a diaper. Sometimes, people get too cute. They’re like, “Hey, why does our baby son look like Jim Gaffigan?” I’m like, “‘Cause I slept with your wife.”\\r\\n Now if you think it’s humiliating to be told you look like a baby, you should know I’ve also been sent photos of cats that supposedly… …look like me. Not once or twice, we’re talking about dozens of different cats. Always the same message. “This cat looks like Jim Gaffigan.” I don’t know what they’re implying, you know. That I fathered a cat out of wedlock? When I was lonely after a show so I went for a walk and… an alley cat asked for a cigarette and… I said I don’t smoke and… well, we started talking and… before you know it, the sun was coming up. I never saw that cat again. I can still smell her dander. Now, if you think it’s humiliating to be told you look like a baby or a cat, you should know I was once sent a photo of someone’s kneecap… …with the message, “This kneecap looks like Jim Gaffigan.” – And you know what? – I did look like that kneecap. But I don’t know what they were implying, you know. That I fathered a kneecap out of wedlock? That I was lonely after a show and… I went for a walk and a kneecap asked for a cigarette and… and I said I don’t smoke and… we started talking. Before you know it, the sun was coming up. I never saw that kneecap again. Now, if you think it’s humiliating… …to be told you look like the fleshy, wrinkly part of a stranger’s leg… it is. Or, uh, you know, I thought it was. And then I had this realization. I figured out what had happened. You know, it all made sense. There might be one person in here that’s like, “Jim, you’re crazy.” But I think the rest of you will see the logic here. What happened is, this kneecap person, obviously, went to a plastic surgeon… Right? And said, “I would like my kneecap to look like the most underrated comedian in America.” Right? And the plastic surgeon said, “You mean John Mulaney?” And the kneecap person said, “No, Jim Gaffigan.” And the plastic surgeon said, “I don’t know who that is.” And then the kneecap person said, “He’s kind of a pale, pudgy guy who looks like a baby or a cat.” That’s probably what happened.\\r\\n That’s weird. I normally get told I look like other humans though. I, uh… In Utah, I always get told I look Mormon. I didn’t even know you could look like a religion. But apparently, I do. And I’ve done research. I don’t look like one of the founders of the Mormons. I don’t look like a present leader of the Mormons. I don’t even look like a guy who could have more than one wife. I just somehow look Mormon. Of course, the Mormons no longer practice polygamy. But for a while there, a Mormon man could have more than one wife. I don’t know if that was a selling point. ‘Cause I love my wife, and I can honestly say I don’t want another one. I feel like disappointing one person is enough. Could you imagine having \",\n","  'two spouses mad at you? And you couldn’t drink coffee? No, thanks.\\r\\n I hope it doesn’t sound like I’m picking on Mormons. Most organized religions have negative stereotypes. Luckily, I’m Catholic, so I don’t have to worry about that, all right. Sometimes people don’t believe me. Like, “Are you really Catholic?” “No, I’m just saying that to impress you.” “I wanna come across like I have good judgment.”\\r\\n At this point, it’s almost like Catholics are trying to lose followers. They’re like, “What else can we do? What else?” “Why don’t we make Bill Cosby pope? Let’s try that.” Catholics have made an art of shrinking their religion. Even back to the Great Schism of 1054 where the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholics split apart, the Orthodox were like, “We wanna celebrate Christmas in January.” And the Catholics were like, “We like pedophiles.” I know. That one’s hard for me too. And then there was the, uh, Protestant Reformation. You didn’t even know this is a religion history class, did you? No, there was the Protestant Reformation in the 1500s when Martin Luther, who probably thought he’d be the most famous Martin Luther… Right? He was like, “That’s it. I’m the king of Martin Luthers.” “Don’t be surprised if one day, I get my own holiday.” No, Martin Luther, he had those 95 problems, but a bitch ain’t one, right? ‘Cause at the time, the Catholic church was super corrupt. Thankfully, it’s not anymore.\\r\\n Some Catholics get really angry. “You’re so critical of Catholic church, why you even Catholic?” Because I believe human beings are inherently flawed. That’s one of the reasons. But mainly, I’m afraid of my wife. Huh?\\r\\n I don’t think there’s anything intrinsically wrong with organized religion. It’s just the human interpretation, right? Most organized religions, God’s saying a similar thing. He’s like, “I want you to love one another.” And the humans are like, “Got it, got it. He said kill gay people, so…” “Let’s get to work.”\\r\\n As a result, all organized religions are struggling right now. Muslims, they’re killing it. Muslims are like, “Oh, Catholics, you think you can alienate people?” “Hold my hummus.” “Let me show you how it’s done.”\\r\\n I’m sure some of you are looking at me like, “Hey, Jim, you look like a former Hitler Youth.” “What are your views on Judaism?” “I’d like to see you destroy your career tonight.” Well, I’m not frightened. I’ll tell you what I think. I think Judaism is perfect. There’s nothing wrong with it. And I’d like to be in more feature films. That’s… That’s some, uh… That’s some good old-fashioned pandering anti-Semitism.\\r\\n Really, the only organized religion, without a negative stereotype, is Buddhism. Right? You’d think more Americans would be Buddhists. ‘Cause if you look at Buddha, he kind of looks like an American. Buddha looks like someone you’d watch the game with. “Buddha always gets a keg for the playoffs.” “Buddha! Buddha!” You know, in real life, Buddha was thin. He wasn’t even a big guy. They made him heavy to make the religion more appealing. ‘Cause at that time, being heavy was a sign of success. Also at that time, being lighter-skinned was a sign of success. So back then, I would have been like Jeff Bezos, so…\\r\\n Bezos. Who’s your favorite billionaire-pretend astronaut? Hmm? Can you believe there’s a choice? And it’s not between just two. We live in a day when billionaires are building their own rockets to fly to outer space, and no one’s saying, “Are you sure they’re paying all their taxes?” “‘Cause I know some teachers that need supplies.” It’s like these billionaires are trying to execute the plan of a five-year-old boy. “When I grow up, I’m gonna be a bazillionaire!” “And I’m gonna build my own spaceship!” “And fly to outer space!” “Okay, Jeffrey.” “But now it’s time for bed.”\\r\\n I almost feel sorry for the accountants of the billionaires. ‘Cause they were like, “You had an amazing year.” “You made 40 billion dollars.” “But I fudged the numbers so it looks like you broke even.” “As long as you lay low and don’t draw attention, we should be fine.” “You got anything coming up?” “I built a rocket…” “…to fly to outer space.” “You know I meant to lay low on this planet.” “Does it matter if the rocket’s shaped like a penis?”\\r\\n I do enjoy the reasoning of the billionaires for going to space. They’re like, “I’m going to outer space so eventually you can go to outer space.” “I’m going so you can go.” “I don’t wanna go to outer space.” “I wanna go to Italy.” Why don’t you work on that?\\r\\n I saw a hitchhiker recently. You never see that anymore. Of course, we no longer refer to them as “hitchhikers.” Now we call them “murderers”. Which is what they do. They murder the nice people that give them rides. Talk about a lack of gratitude. “Thanks for picking me up.” Stab.\\r\\n Hitchhiking disappeared ’cause it was dangerous for both participants. Right? The hitchhiker and the driver. And, you know, at one point, there must have been like a murderer driving around looking to pick up a hitchhiker, and he picked up a hitchhiker who was also a murderer. ',\n","  'And the driver was like, “I’m gonna kill you.” And the hitchhiker was like, “I’m gonna kill you.” And I bet they had a laugh. I bet they laughed. And then slowly but surely, “they fell in love.” “And that’s what my musical’s about.” It’s called Hitched.\\r\\n Flew in Thursday, uh, driving from the airport, I saw this guy on a motorcycle and he looked so happy. You know, and whenever I see a motorcycle that’s on the highway, I always have the same thought. “You’re gonna die.” “What are you doing on the highway? You’re gonna die.” And the only reason I say that is ’cause they’re gonna die. I don’t even know what the thinking is. “Well, I have to travel a long distance.” “Should I take the car or this motorized chair with no seat belt?” “If I sneeze, I’ll never walk again.” “Live to ride.” And then die!\\r\\n I heard the motorcycle before I saw it. We’ve all heard those loud motorcycles. “Wow, how small is his penis?” And I didn’t know that’s the reason some motorcycles are so loud is ’cause they want you to know they’re gonna die.\\r\\n I have friends that love motorcycles. Some women are really into bikers. They’re like, “I just like a man who’s dangerous, who can’t afford a car.” “And who’s definitely gonna die.”\\r\\n But bikers are fascinating, right? What a uniquely American subculture. They’re all about macho independence, right? They’re all about the independence. Like, “I just wanna be out on the road, just me and my bike, alone, with 30 other guys.” “In matching outfits.” “Riding in tandem so close, we can French-kiss each other.” He’s gonna get beat up by a marching band and a gang of bikers.\\r\\n Bikers are grown men who make the same phone calls of an eight-year-old boy. “You guys wanna ride bikes tonight?” “Well, I don’t wanna go alone. It’s scary out there. Ask your mommy.”\\r\\n The reason that’s funny is ’cause bikers are so intimidating, right? They’re angry. Bikers seem angry, and I think it’s ’cause they’re cold. Right? That vest with no shirt? That’s gotta be chilly. “Oh, I wish I had a shawl.” “Shawl and my Uggs.” “Maybe a pumpkin spice latte.” That vest with no shirt is so common among bikers. Is there like peer pressure? “Look at Curtis over there, wearing a T-shirt under his vest like a girl.” “Let’s kick his ass.” “And then kiss him.”\\r\\n Occasionally, you’ll see a biker giving someone a ride on the back of their motorcycle, it’s usually a woman. Guys don’t wanna ride on the back. Mm. It’s hard to get a ride on the back of a motorcycle without giving an extended intimate hug. “Let’s get out of here, Virgil.” “You smell wonderful, Virgil.” “What is that, lilac?” “You’ve been doing sit-ups, Virgil?”\\r\\n During the summer, occasionally, you’ll see a bicyclist on the highway. See a cyclist on the highway, they’re always dressed like they’re competing in the Tour de France. “You’re losing!” “And you’re also gonna die.”\\r\\n Those bicyclists, they have to settle down with the helmet design. It’s all super aerodynamic. It’s like, “You’re not going that fast.” You’re riding a bike. You’re not in the movie Tron. And put on some clothes! What’s with the spandex? Are you on your way to wrestle Blue Man Group? How many Blue Man references you’re gonna have?\\r\\n You ever see a bicyclist on the highway and they’re not in spandex, they’re just in regular clothes? They look like they have a DUI. Should’ve Ubered.\\r\\n You never see a cyclist giving someone a ride, right? There’s no room. They’re already sitting on that door handle of a seat. “I’m just gonna sit here for five hours.” “I don’t know why I can’t have children.” Right, I’m going after the cyclist. What are they gonna do? Throw their baby bottle of water at me? “I’d chase you, but for no reason at all, I’m wearing cleats.” Are those cleats necessary? You’re in a Starbucks. “Do you have oat milk?”\\r\\n I think it’s interesting, people who ride bicycles are called “cyclists,” but people who ride motorcycles are called “bikers”? You know, that’s just the bikers bullying the cyclists. “Hey, we’re gonna take the name ‘biker.’ You can’t use it.” And the cyclist went, “Motorcycle doesn’t even have the word ‘bike’ in it.” “We don’t care.” “Also, we’re gonna dress like that guy from the Village People.” Sun-glass guy’s like, “Well, we were gonna do that.” “No, you’re gonna dress like rhythmic gymnasts.” “Okay.”\\r\\n Bikers and cyclists both dress like they’re on their way to a costume party. No other form of transportation has a uniform. You never see everyone on the cruise ship dress like pirates ’cause it’s not necessary. Bikers and cyclists, both on two wheels, nothing in common. It’s like they’re trying to be different. Even the placement of the handlebars… Some cyclists have handlebars in real tight, some bikers have their handlebars way up here. “Oh, this is comfortable.” “This reminds me of my Big Wheel.” “Now I know why I have my wallet on a chain.”\\r\\n You never see a unicyclist on the highway. You know why? ‘Cause they’re all dead. ‘Cause I killed them. You’re welcome. Is there any bigger attention-grab than riding a unicycle? I guess a pogo st',\n","  'ick, right? What was the pitch for the pogo stick? “It’s a stick you can jump on twice and then fall on your face.” “Interesting. If you practice, do you get better?” “Not at all, no.” “I’ll take one.”\\r\\n But unicyclists, they act like they don’t want the attention. They always have that super casual look on their face, but their legs are so frantic. They’re always like… “Oh, hey, what’s going on, everyone?” “Oh, I’m not doing anything.” “Does anyone have three bowling pins I could juggle?” “I could annoy you with two unnecessary skills.” That joke takes way too much effort.\\r\\n Oh, you may have noticed that there’s a piano on stage. And, uh, some of you may be wondering, “Hey, why would Jim Gaffigan have a piano on stage?” And… What you may not realize is that I… do not play the piano. “Jim, that was…” “Really? Did he bring the piano just for that joke?” “That’s pathetic.”\\r\\n Good-looking crowd here. Wow. Very good-looking. Very good-looking crowd, huh? Well, not all of you, you know. Not all of you. But I’m not breaking any news, right? We know where we stand. Yeah, we learn from such an early age. Like, I remember kindergarten, the girls would chase the cute boys at recess, and let’s just say I didn’t do a lot of running. Or any running. I remember being five years old and going, “Oh, this is how it’s gonna be.” “I’m gonna have to write some jokes.” “And I’ll be hanging out with the fellas.”\\r\\n I still hang out with the fellas. All right, I had a friend during the lockdown who spent the entire time planning a guys’ weekend. Every time I talk to him, he would make it sound less appealing. “Dude, this is what we’re gonna do.” “We’re gonna rent a cabin for the weekend. Just guys, no women.” “I’m already out.” “No, no, no. Think about it. Just guys, no women.” “We’ll smoke cigars, play poker all weekend.” “Sounds horrible.” “You’re not thinking it through.” “Just guys, no women, for a whole weekend, like we’re in prison.” “I look forward to it.”\\r\\n Every year, my brother Mitch goes on a golfing trip with 30 men. Thirty men. They fly to Florida. They rent three houses. Ten men to a house. They play golf in the morning, they eat lunch together, they play golf in the afternoon, and then they go back to the houses, I don’t know, have sex with each other. I don’t know what they do. It sounds horrible. How much fellowship can you have? My brother is not gay and, obviously, I wouldn’t care if he was. But if he ever came out, he could be like, “I gave you so many hints.” “I literally vacationed with 30 men.” “We rented out a cul-de-sac.” “We played with sticks and balls all day.” “How clear did I have to make it?” I guess the point I’m trying to make is golf makes people gay. So… So the next time a friend says, “I’m going to play golf with the fellas,” just be like, “Enjoy.”\\r\\n No, I prefer mixed company. I do, you know. There’s a cliché that men are dumb and I have enough male friends to know that’s based on some truth. Every man in here has that friend that they occasionally look at and wonder how they hold down a job. And if you don’t think that about a friend, that means you’re the friend. Yeah.\\r\\n My friend like that is Ricky. He’s a great guy. Ricky and I, one time, we went axe-throwing. Don’t know if you’ve done that. Throw an axe, you drink a beer. You try and forget our democracy is in crisis and… At one point, Ricky turned to me and he goes, “Hey, before axe-throwing, what did they use axes for?” “Uh…” “Chopping wood?” He’s like, “Really?” And I was like, “Don’t talk anymore.” And like a good friend, I ran home, turned it into a stand-up bit. And I kind of forgot about it. Then, like a month later, Ricky called me out of the blue and goes, “I did it. I did it.” “I built my own axe-throwing range in my backyard.” Yeah, he’s divorced. And… Then he immediately starts bragging. He’s like, “Yeah, now, I could throw an axe 20 yards and hit a bullseye.” I’m like, “That’s impressive.” “You know when that’s gonna come in handy? Never.” He’ll be like, “Hey, you never know.” I’m like, “No, I do know.” Even if someone broke in your house and you happen to be holding an axe, you’re not gonna be able to say, “Hey, can you come 10 feet closer?”\\r\\n I like having women around for many reasons, not least of which is, they’re attractive and men are not. You know? Like when a guy’s good-looking, it’s like a fluke of nature. And you know what all attractive men have in common? They kind of look like women. Right? That’s the only way straight guys can tell who’s good-looking. “Wow, he must be attractive. He barely looks like a dude.”\\r\\n Women are attractive and compared to men, they’re very clean. Men are gross. And make very little effort to not be gross. Like, if aliens visited Earth, they’ll be so confused. They’ll be like, “The attractive feminine gender is taking an hour to get ready and those hairy beasts are just ready?” “No wonder this planet’s always at war.”\\r\\n Men are gross and as they get older, grosser. When women get older, they become more elegant. As men get older, they look like they’r',\n","  'e decomposing. You ever seen an old guy with the shirt off? He looks like the first draft of a human. What is that, a Simpsons character? Because when men get older, things stop working. The synapses stop connecting. Normally, brain’s like, “Every month, I’m gonna grow hair on this guy’s head. “Every month, I’m gonna grow hair on this guy’s head.” But one month, the brain’s like, “Every month, I’m gonna grow hair everywhere but this guy’s head.” I have hair growing in parts of my body… I don’t need. Do you wanna know why older men grow hair on weird parts of their body? That’s nature’s way of saying, “You’re done.” “Stop mating or I’m going to turn you into a throw rug.”\\r\\n I have some body hair, not as bad as some men, which is a relief, ’cause as you can see, I did not win the genetic lottery. I am bald, blind and pale. It wouldn’t surprise me if I woke up tomorrow with a tail. “Have you seen the comic with the tail?” “He’s very pale and the tail even has a bald spot.” I saw a guy this summer at the pool, he’s probably 60, had his shirt off. Not a lot of body hair. All body hair. For a second, I thought they were shooting a GEICO commercial. This guy was… He was so hairy I had to stop my youngest son from trying to pet him. “Let him smell your hand first, son.” This guy was hairy and he was walking around the pool with the confidence like he’d spent a lifetime dealing with hairy situations. No one said anything, but everyone had the same thought: “Please don’t go in the pool.” “No one’s prepared to see you shake dry.” And this man walked right by everyone, and he sat down next to an attractive woman. And I was so impressed. That woman could look beyond this man’s appearance and focus solely on his wallet.\\r\\n Whoo!\\r\\n But we all wanna be good-looking, right? We all wanna be chased on the playground, right? Some people go so far as to get plastic surgery. They’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna sound desperate, but can you take a knife to my face?” “And make me pretty. Just keep cutting!”\\r\\n It’s kind of amazing more of us don’t get plastic surgery because we live in a beauty-obsessed society, right? There are studies. There was a Harvard study, that found that children believed good-looking people are nicer. That study also found that children are stupid. We definitely give good-looking people the benefit of the doubt. Like if a really attractive person’s quiet, we think they’re mysterious. If a fat person is quiet, we assume they’re thinking about food. And we are, we are, but there’s still a mystery. You don’t know what kind of food. All right, it’s cake. It’s always cake. But you don’t know what kind. All right, it’s red velvet.\\r\\n As a result, we just like being around beautiful people. You ever been out to eat and you have a waiter or waitress that’s really attractive? For a second, you’re like, “Wow, this is gonna be a good meal.” You ever have an ugly waiter, you’re like, “Should we leave?” I think that’s why buffets started. “You know what, I’ll get my own food. Thank you.” “I don’t need that mug near my entrée. You know what I mean?” “Jim, you’re a monster.”\\r\\n We follow good-looking people on social media, Instagram. Beautiful people have millions of followers and we like their photos and sometimes, we put a flame emoji. It’s totally socially acceptable. If you did that in real life, you’d go to jail. “Excuse me, sir, what are you doing?” “I’m following that lady.” “Uh, Can I ask why?” “I like to look at her.” “Can you give her this torch I brought her?” “And these prayer hands.”\\r\\n Everyone’s got to settle down with the prayer hands emoji. The overuse is ridiculous. Got a text from a friend, “See you at dinner. Prayer hands.” “No. No prayer hands. Are you not gonna make it?” “What are you suggesting? That we eat hands for dinner?”\\r\\n My wife is very good-looking. That’s right, I’m part of a mixed couple. It’s not fair. She’s good-looking, she’s smart, she’s creative. But you know what? Horrible taste in men. So it evens out. I’m happily married, but I would say, once a week, I catch my wife giving me a look, like, “I’m gonna have to let you go.” ‘Cause I disappoint her constantly. I do things that annoy. Like, here’s something I do that annoys my wife. I use the bathroom. I know. I shouldn’t, right? I get in trouble for not telling her I’m gonna use the bathroom. “You just disappeared. Where’d you go?” “I didn’t know I needed a hall pass.”\\r\\n I also get in trouble for telling her I’m gonna use the bathroom. “Uh, I’m gonna use the bathroom.” “Again?” “Are you okay?” “How many times is that today?” “You’re disgusting.” “What do you do in there?” “Mostly get away from you.”\\r\\n When my wife’s annoyed with me, she doesn’t give me the silent treatment. She’ll just take too long to answer a simple question. She’ll be standing a foot away, looking at her phone and I’ll be like, “What time do we have to do that school thing?” And she’ll just be like… “It’s in the calendar.” I’ll be like, “Uh, are you mad at me?” “No.”\\r\\n Recently, we learned that this couple that we’re friends with are',\n","  ' getting a divorce. And not surprisingly, my wife was very upset. With me. I wasn’t surprised ’cause this wasn’t the first time something I had nothing to do with was my fault. Trump’s election, the Kavanaugh hearings, that was my fault. And I apologize ’cause I unconsciously planned the whole thing.\\r\\n Now, I would never describe my wife as crazy, ’cause I like to be married. But I do think it’s interesting that if a man calls another man crazy, it’s a compliment. “Here’s my buddy, Joey. He’s crazy.” Joey’s like, “Oh, you’re just being nice.” But if I was like, “This is my wife, Jeannie. She’s crazy.” I even get nervous saying that. She’s back in New York, but you never know. ‘Cause if my wife was standing here and I was like, “This is my wife, she’s crazy,” I’d be dead. And all of you would applaud. You’d be like, “Well, that was a teachable moment. Yeah.” “We learned something.” No, we’re hanging in there.\\r\\n By the way, if at the start of the pandemic, you were in a relationship and you’re still in that relationship, you should get money, right? Right? Because before the pandemic, if you’d hear of a couple splitting up, you were like, “Oh, no.” But during the pandemic, when you’d hear of a break up, you’re like, “Oh, of course.” You felt for the couples that stayed together. “You’re still together? Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.” “Co-dependency, huh?” ‘Cause it doesn’t matter how strong your relationship was. At one point during the pandemic, you looked at your partner and thought, “I think I’d rather have the coronavirus.”\\r\\n I know that sounds horrible, but it’s true. Everyone had that moment where they’re like, “You know, how uncomfortable is that ventilator?” “I know I wouldn’t be able to talk, but does that mean I wouldn’t be able to hear her?” “Do they have a ventilator just for the ears?” “Jim, you’re a monster.”\\r\\n My wife’s an amazing mother. We have five children. Can you believe that? Five children. Thank you. Thank you. It is something I regret… …’cause there’s too many of them. There’s way too many. Sometimes at dinner, I just pretend I’m hosting a reality show… …called So You Think You’re Going To College. ‘Cause they all can’t go. They all can’t go, not if I’m getting that boat. I’m kidding. Obviously, I’m not getting the boat… not until I get a motorcycle, you know.\\r\\n My kids find me annoying. All children find their parents annoying, which is kind of ironic, given children essentially ruined their parents’ lives. Right? Parents give their children their time, their energy and their money, and we repay our parents with resentment. Have you ever seen an adult get a phone call from one of their parents? You’d think it was a debt collector. “Ugh. It’s my mom.” “Yeah, I know you took care of me for a quarter of a century, but now is not a good time.” “You know what wasn’t a good time? Giving up my dreams… …so you could be a general disappointment.”\\r\\n No, I would never suggest that children are God’s punishment for having sex. But an argument could be made. And he’s up there, “Oh, they’re enjoying that way too much.” “How can I get them to pray tomorrow?”\\r\\n I do love being a parent. It’s the most important thing I’ll do in my life. But it’s an insane proposition. You give your children everything. You give them everything and then just one day, they leave. They’re like, “See you! Thanks for nothing.” “I’ll let you know if I need help with a mortgage.”\\r\\n Sometimes they don’t leave, right? They just stick around. They turn into roommates. Not going to happen in my house. I already have a backpack for each of them. They’ve seen the bags, “What’s that?” I’m like, “When you turn 18, that’s your going-away present.” “Jim, you’re a monster.”\\r\\n I try to be a good dad. I feel like I make more of an effort than my father. My dad’s generation, they didn’t have to do anything. My dad never went to a parent-teacher conference. My dad didn’t even know I went to school. My father couldn’t be bothered to turn his head if something was happening behind him. “What the hell’s going on back there?” I don’t know if he couldn’t turn his head or if it wasn’t worth the effort. “What the hell is going on back there?” “Oh, we’re celebrating my birthday.” “Oh, keep it down. I’m watching Ironsides.”\\r\\n ♪ Happy birthday ♪\\r\\n ♪ To you ♪\\r\\n My children give me guilt trips I wouldn’t even contemplate. Like my daughter was in a play on Thursday and Friday, so I went on Thursday night and then Friday morning, she saw me with my rolly bag and was like, “Oh, you’re not coming to my show tonight?” I’m like, “You’ve never been to one of my shows.” “I do 300 a year.”\\r\\n My big plan was to teach my children responsibility by selling posters after one of my shows. So I texted my teenage daughter. I’m like, “Do you wanna sell posters after my show? I’ll pay you.” She texted back, “Great, sounds good.” Then I texted my teenage son. “Do you want to sell posters after my show? I’ll pay you.” He texted back, “No thanks. I don’t need the money.” He doesn’t have any money. He has my money. I just texted back, “You',\n","  '’re out of the will.” I’m kidding. He was never in it.\\r\\n If my father asked me to do something, he wouldn’t even stick around for an answer. “You wanna shovel the driveway?” Then he’d just leave. It was understood I was gonna shovel the driveway or move out.\\r\\n I was kind of frightened of my dad. My children treat me like some bank teller they reluctantly have to deal with. Once a week, they just appear in front of me. “Hmm… Mom said I could get a shark… …so I guess I need your credit card.” I’m like, “What are you talking about?” “He’s yelling again, Mom!”\\r\\n If my dad was in a room in the house, I wouldn’t go to that side of the house. “I’ll just pee outside.” And I had all these older siblings that used to send me in there to ask questions. “Go ask Dad if we can go to Dairy Queen.” “I’m not doing it. I’m not doing it.” “Go. You’re too young to kill.” “Dad?” “What the hell do you want?” “He said, no.”\\r\\n When I didn’t have kids, I didn’t understand my dad at all. By the way, if you don’t have children, none of this should make sense. Or even the concept of a Saturday night. When you don’t have kids, you’re like, “Saturday!” And when you’re a parent, you’re like, “Who can we pay to come to this house… …and watch this child?” And your standards drop so dramatically. Initially, like, “They should have a PhD.” And then you’re like, “Well, how long were they in jail?” “Murder? It wasn’t children, right?” “A Satanist? You’ll fit right in.”\\r\\n Any parent will tell you that, like, having children has enriched their lives. It’s exposed them to things they never thought they’d do. Like kids just… You end up doing things you never thought you’d do. Like for me, going outside. You ever go outside with real little kids? You don’t even know what to do with them. You’re like, “Well, I normally just drink out here.” “Who wants to play a game of nap?”\\r\\n It’s weird when your kids have a friend that you’re not a fan of. “Oh, Tommy’s coming over? Well, I’ll be leaving.” “You can text me when Tommy is gone… …’cause he’s immature.”\\r\\n I wasn’t prepared for all the activities kids have. You pick up your kid and bring them to an activity, then to another activity. And if they don’t have an activity, you have to think of one, or they’ll smoke meth. You’re always looking for an activity as a parent. I took my kids to Ripley’s Believe It or Not. I don’t know if you’ve ever been that desperate for something to do. What can I tell you about Ripley’s Believe It or Not? It’s mostly not. It’s not interesting. It’s not even a lot of stuff. It’s like they just emptied out some drifter’s storage unit. I do admire that business model, you know. Most businesses attempt to establish trust with the customer. Not Ripley’s. Like, “Believe it… or not. We don’t care.” “We know you’re not coming back.”\\r\\n I’m still getting used to having teenagers. Recently, my 17-year-old daughter told me that she wants to be an actor, which is so crazy ’cause when I was that age, that movie Dead Poets Society came out, which is an amazing movie with Robin Williams, where he plays this teacher who inspires these students to seize the day, right? And one of the students wants to be an actor. And, you know, he joins the play and he invites his dad to see the play and after the play, he tells his dad that he wants to be an actor. Dad’s like, “You’re not gonna be an actor, that’s stupid. Waste of time and money…” The kid’s so distraught he kills himself, and then the teacher gets fired and all the kids stand on desks… Anyway, it’s a great movie. No, now… now that I’m the parent of a teenager, I realized that dad in Dead Poets Society was right. I’m kidding. I know the point of the movie is, “Don’t be a teacher.” My wife hates that joke so much.\\r\\n My kids, I don’t know what they think. I don’t even think my kids know what I do for a living. Or I should say I didn’t think they knew what I did for a living till last Halloween. My 10-year-old, Michael, didn’t know what he wanted to be for Halloween, which is a crisis. If you’re a parent, you know this. Then, like, two days before Halloween, he ran up to me and he goes, “I know what I’m gonna be for Halloween.” “I’m gonna be a stand-up comedian.” And I was so touched. I was like, “Oh, my gosh, for Halloween, you wanna be your dad.” And he goes, “No, I wanna be John Mulaney.” Slap! Right across the face.\\r\\n Thank you so much, you guys.

Wow.\\r\\n And–\\r\\n Another hand for the most overqualified opening act, Mr. Lewis Black.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n And another hand for Jann Arden, who couldn’t be here to sing that in real life but was nice enough to send that to me in the computer.\\r\\n And a big hand for you people that are borderline alcoholics.\\r\\n You’ve made it out tonight.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n You’ve–\\r\\n [cheering continues]\\r\\n I do feel a kinship. This is a beer town.\\r\\n I’m from a beer town. I’m actually from St. Louis, Missouri.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n Thank you. You like that.\\r\\n Specifically, I’m from very near Ferguson. Maybe you saw our travel brochure.\\r\\n People are like, “Really? Are you really from there?”\\r\\n Yeah, I am.\\r\\n They’re like, “Can you believe all that happened?”\\r\\n Yeah, I can.\\r\\n I can’t believe we kept a lid on that shit for 25 years.\\r\\n Every day I felt the tension. Every day.\\r\\n Even In high school, I came home and I said, “I don’t really know if our school’s that safe anymore, Dad. A girl got stabbed to death in the third-floor bathroom.”\\r\\n He didn’t stop doing the crossword puzzle.\\r\\n He goes, “Well, don’t use that bathroom. What are you, a goddamn idiot, Kathleen? Jesus Christ. Use your mind.”\\r\\n It’s not a very exciting state, Missouri.\\r\\n It’s really just in the middle–\\r\\n Clearly, though, to Southerners it’s not.\\r\\n I was in Birmingham, Alabama.\\r\\n I get done with the show, and this guy at the bar goes, “Ma’am, I could tell by the way you talk you’re a Yankee.”\\r\\n I’m like, “Sir, I’m from Missouri.\\r\\n And let me tell you this little piece of history.\\r\\n I don’t even know if we were in the war.\\r\\n I think we were half and half and just beat the crap out of one another.\\r\\n We never even left our own property, sir.”\\r\\n “Fight Local.” That was our bumper sticker.\\r\\n “Fight Local.”\\r\\n ’Cause we couldn’t decide.\\r\\n We were half Confederate and half Union. We still can’t decide.\\r\\n CNN had a map of the Syrian refugee crisis, a map of the United States, and who would take them and who wouldn’t.\\r\\n The South, yellow. No.\\r\\n The Northeast said yes, we’ll take ’em. Blue.\\r\\n For no reason explained till the very end of the show, Missouri was purple.\\r\\n The only state.\\r\\n And then at the end, they go, “Oh, the purple signifies no decision.\\r\\n They can’t make up their minds.”\\r\\n Of course we can’t make up our minds.\\r\\n I don’t really consider, um–\\r\\n I don’t know what I consider. I don’t know if it’s north or south.\\r\\n But I know sometimes when I’m in the South, I see things on bumper stickers, I read things in their newspaper where I think to myself, seriously, I think we may need to have this Civil War again.\\r\\n I’m not sure they got it.\\r\\n I feel like it’s beating up a drunk in an alley and then wake up and be like, “That was bullshit.\\r\\n I wasn’t ready. Come back.”\\r\\n No. No, drunky. We’re not coming back.\\r\\n I was in Louisiana, and you can google this.\\r\\n ’Cause I couldn’t believe this was true. It is true.\\r\\n They are teaching children in schools in Louisiana that will accept vouchers.\\r\\n So that’s tax money.\\r\\n They’re private schools, but they accept vouchers.\\r\\n This is in science class.\\r\\n Now, put on your science hat and try to follow this syllogism.\\r\\n They’re teaching the kids that the Loch Ness Monster is real.\\r\\n Now, as an aside, I agree with that.\\r\\n But nobody taught me that.\\r\\n I had to stay up really late watching the Discovery Channel, drinking a lot of wine and weeding through a lot of crap to make my decision.\\r\\n Anyway, they’re teaching the children that the Loch Ness Monster is real.\\r\\n Therefore, evolution is not real ’cause the Loch Ness Monster is a dinosaur.\\r\\n I don’t even have a joke for that. I just want you to know that.\\r\\n Those are fellow Americans that I think should be airlifted out. I–\\r\\n Someone needs to get the children. Leave the adults.\\r\\n Take the children.\\r\\n My state is not a state that you really wanna brag about.\\r\\n We just try to lay low. That’s our best outcome: if we’re not noticed.\\r\\n Because every time– Like Ferguson, that whole thing.\\r\\n That was not exactly something that you feel proud of.\\r\\n Uh, two summers ago, I turned on CNN somewhere on the road, and it said, “Missouri State Senate debates–”\\r\\n Now, you think the next word would be “health care” or “right-to-work clause.”\\r\\n No. “Noodling.”\\r\\n Yeah. We spent two weeks, eight hours a day, the senate.\\r\\n For those of you who don’t know what noodling is, congratulations.\\r\\n You have led a very classy life.\\r\\n But I’m gonna tell you what it is.\\r\\n Noodling is when hillbilly people get in muddy rivers, like the Mississippi or the Missouri River, and they get into water about chest high and then they go along the riverbank with their hands underneath the water searching for catfish breeding holes.\\r\\n Then when they find one, they shove their arm in the hole.\\r\\n They wait for the catfish to bite it.\\r\\n Then they yank it out and they’ve caught a fish.\\r\\n I was not aware that this is illegal in my home state of Missouri.\\r\\n I was also not aware that it is legal in our neighboring state of Oklahoma.\\r\\n I certainly was not aware that we have a Missouri Noodlers Association.\\r\\n CNN sent a young reporter to interview the president of the Missouri Noodlers Association, who immediately became my new hero because for his interview on CNN, he chose not to wear a shirt.\\r\\n [audience cheering]\\r\\n She was clearly petrified of the guy.\\r\\n I have never seen anyone hold a microphone further away from another human being.\\r\\n She said, “Sir, I understand you’re the president of the ',\n","  'Missouri Noodlers Association.\\r\\n Could you please tell us your position on noodling?”\\r\\n He goes, “Yeah. Yeah.\\r\\n I’ll tell you my position.\\r\\n If I wanna shove my arm in a hole and get a fish, you tell my why I can’t.”\\r\\n So that was the argument for it.\\r\\n Then I thought, what is the problem? I don’t know.\\r\\n Well, they go interview the people against it.\\r\\n It was, like, basically an environmental group, and they go, “Well, our problem with it is two-fold.\\r\\n Number one, every time they do this, they’re destroying the catfish breeding holes.\\r\\n And number two, and more importantly, sometimes these catfish, especially if near a dam, can grow to be 150 to 250 pounds.”\\r\\n Yes. I swear. Google it.\\r\\n “So sometimes when the hillbilly shoves his arm in the hole, the hillbilly does not come back up.”\\r\\n But I was like, “Yeah, but let’s think that through.\\r\\n What have we gained and what have we lost?”\\r\\n Everything–\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n “We might have lost Billy Bob, but somebody just got his brand-new truck full of Busch light.”\\r\\n What?\\r\\n I don’t expect people to know much about Missouri.\\r\\n I do expect people to know it’s a state. That I do.\\r\\n And there are people–\\r\\n I was in California, in a Macy’s, trying to buy jeans.\\r\\n And the girl was young, I’ll give her that.\\r\\n [imitating valley girl] She was one of the girls who talk like that, and she just couldn’t be bothered with anything, okay?\\r\\n [normal voice] I go to check out and I give her my credit card.\\r\\n She goes, “I’m gonna need to see your license.”\\r\\n I go, “Okay, that’s not a problem.”\\r\\n And I–\\r\\n I’m still not sure exactly what happened. I’m gonna show you what happened.\\r\\n I gave her my license, and she went, “Missouri.” [clicks teeth]\\r\\n “Uh… no.”\\r\\n “No? Did you just do a search in your brain and your hard drive came back with nothing, so you negated my whole state?”\\r\\n “Uh, no.”\\r\\n Missouri is a very special place to one group of people, and it’s the Mormons.\\r\\n Not the ones that went to Utah.\\r\\n Joseph Smith, the leader, had a son, Joseph Smith, Jr.\\r\\n That man believed that the original Garden of Eden was 35 miles north of Kansas City.\\r\\n Not in Mesopotamia.\\r\\n No, no, no, no, no.\\r\\n Missouri.\\r\\n They also believe that when Christ comes back, that’s where he’s going.\\r\\n First stop, Kansas City.\\r\\n He’s not gonna go to Bethlehem or Jerusalem.\\r\\n He’s getting a Southwest flight and he’s going straight to Kansas City.\\r\\n Look, I am from Missouri.\\r\\n And if you think Jesus is going back to Kansas City, 35 miles outside of it, by the way, then you must believe that Jesus is a big fan of barbecue and crystal meth, because that is what’s happening 35 miles outside of Kansas City.\\r\\n My whole family lives there.\\r\\n Well, my parents are in Florida in the winter right now.\\r\\n As most Midwest old people with a car, they leave on December 26.\\r\\n They’re like geese. They just leave.\\r\\n Flocks of ’em leave from the Midwest.\\r\\n My parents bought a new car. They haven’t had a new car in ten years.\\r\\n They bought a black Lincoln Town Car.\\r\\n Little did they know that that’s one of the more expensive rides on the Uber app.\\r\\n So I, unbeknownst to them, have signed them up to be Uber drivers… so they can pick up other old people on the way to Florida, make a little spending cash.\\r\\n ’Cause my mom will do whatever the phone says, I’m telling you.\\r\\n “Jack, we have to pull over. We’re the blue dot, and it’s saying pull over. There are people that need a ride for some reason. I don’t know why the phone is doing this. It’s never done this before. But I’m afraid if we don’t, there’s gonna be a problem, Jack.”\\r\\n They go to Sarasota now, on that side.\\r\\n But for about three years in a row, they went to a place called the Villages.\\r\\n I don’t know if any of you’ve seen it advertised on TV.\\r\\n Go to their Web site. There’s nothing like it in the world.\\r\\n It’s the largest retirement community in the nation.\\r\\n Well, the world, probably.\\r\\n It’s 35 minutes, or if my mom’s driving, eight and a half hours away from the Orlando airport.\\r\\n Some guy thought of it.\\r\\n He thought, “I’m gonna buy all of this crappy swampland, and I’m gonna make nirvana for old people.\\r\\n I’ll build it. They will come.” And they came.\\r\\n There’s 350,000 of ’em.\\r\\n They have their own zip code. They have their own post office.\\r\\n They’ve got golf courses, swimming pools.\\r\\n I mean, it’s really something. It really is something.\\r\\n And my parents were there, and I go, “Oh, good. You’re gonna be at the Villages. That’s great, ’cause I have shows in Florida, and I have nowhere to go in between shows.”\\r\\n My mom goes, “You can come over here, but you can’t spend the night on the property.”\\r\\n I said, “Why not?”\\r\\n She goes, “The law at the Villages, Kathleen, is no one under the age of 55 is allowed to spend the night on the property.”\\r\\n I said, “Really? Fifty-five? So you’re telling me at age 48, I’m gonna have to again go get a fake ID–\\r\\n [audience laughing]\\r\\n so that I can spend the night with you freaks. Mom, where would I even go? To, like, a bingo game and roll an old redheaded lady and go, ‘Sorry. I’ll have this back in two days. I just need it to get into the Villages.’”\\r\\n I said, “Mom, how are they gonna know if I’m there? Seriously. Does an old man come in a golf cart and do bed check every night?”\\r\\n She goes, “Yes. That’s what I’ve heard. Yes. That’s what I think happens.”\\r\\n I said, “Well, I’m going to come there and I am gonna spend the night. But I will meet you halfway so you’re not nervous. I’m gonna sleep in my tennis shoes, sports bra and T-shirt and shorts. And if I hear the golf cart, I’m gonna get up, and I’m gonna run into the family room, and I’m gonna hide behind the La-Z-Boy. ’Cause in my own mind, Mom, I’m gonna pretend like I’m in the last scene of The Sound of Music and we’re the Von Trapps on top of the convent hiding behind tombstones… from the Nazis.\\r\\n And then when the golf cart guy shines his flashlight, just for my own amusement, I’m gonna pop out from behind it and go, ‘Don’t do it',\n","  ', Ralph. You’re not one of them. Don’t take us. Come with us.’ And then I’m gonna laugh and laugh. He won’t laugh, but I don’t care. It’s not the point. I’m gonna laugh. And then I’m gonna run by him, Mom, and I’m gonna run away, and I’m gonna make it over the whole border of the Villages. I’m gonna make it to freedom, and–\\r\\n Do you know how I know I’m confident I can do that? Because I’m the only person out of 350,000 that has both of their real knees, Mom. I am the Usain Bolt of this community. I don’t think you’re respecting my powers.”\\r\\n Prepared to getting older, there’s moments where you’re hanging out with them and you’re like, “Wow. Are you actually going crazy in front of me? Like, should I call someone? I don’t know what to do.”\\r\\n I was in Target with my mom. She opened her wallet and all her credit cards were individually wrapped in tin foil. She unwraps one and hands it to me as if that’s a completely normal exchange of information. I go, “We’re not gonna talk about that?”\\r\\n She goes, “Talk about what, Kathleen?”\\r\\n I go, “The tin foil, Mom. The tin foil.”\\r\\n She goes, “Well, obviously, you have not been keeping up with the news.”\\r\\n I said, “No, I actually thought I had been.”\\r\\n “Well, then you must have missed the story about the raygun people.”\\r\\n “Who are the raygun people?”\\r\\n She said, “Well, your father and I saw it on ‘20-40’ or ‘60-80’ or ‘100 Minutes,’ whatever those serious– It was a very serious program. There are people now, Kathleen, with computer rayguns, and they can shoot that raygun through my purse, through my wallet, and they gather all of your personal information off of that strip on the back of your debit card. They can shoot through your father’s ass at a gas station, right through his ass, into his wallet.”\\r\\n I went, “Okay.” My mom’s not stupid. She was a nurse for a million years. So I called my friend in Boston who’s been a cop forever, and I asked him about the raygun people and told him about the tin foil.\\r\\n He said, “Two things, Kathleen. Number one, no. I have not heard about the raygun people. But in fairness to your mom, I haven’t checked my work e-mail in three days. Now– Number two, and more importantly, what I do know from being a cop for 20 years is that crazy people love tin foil. You don’t need to tell your mother. I’m just telling you so you know that is a fact. An old cop told me that. Always carry tin foil in your squad car. If you come across someone who’s mentally ill and having a psychotic break or maybe someone in a drug frenzy, you just tear off a piece of tin foil, you calmly walk over and go, ‘Make a hat,’ and the whole situation–”\\r\\n They drive to Florida ’cause my mom won’t fly anymore. The fear of flying has literally gone over the edge with her. It started years ago.\\r\\n And I do feel sorry for people who have that fear, ’cause it is real.\\r\\n And you see people at airports. You can always tell.\\r\\n ’Cause their hands, their palms are real sweaty. They’ll talk to anyone.\\r\\n God forbid the time of departure changes.\\r\\n Then they completely unravel. They’re like, “This is it.\\r\\n I think this plane’s broken, and they’re gonna fly it. Don’t you?”\\r\\n “Yeah, I do. Today is the day.\\r\\n American Airlines is gonna go, ‘Fuck it. Give it a whirl. I don’t care.’\\r\\n Wha– Every part can’t be that important.”\\r\\n But it’s weird to me that strangers– There will always be a stranger who will say to another stranger, “Oh, you shouldn’t have a fear of flying, because I’ll tell you what, you have a better chance of being in a car crash than you do of being in a plane crash.”\\r\\n And I wanna say, but I won’t ’cause it would be mean, “Yeah, but you have a much better chance of getting in a forgettable car crash than you do of being in a forgettable plane crash.”\\r\\n There’s no way you’re gonna be in a plane crash, go to work on Monday, and then Wednesday look at somebody you work with\\r\\n and go, “Oh, shit, did I forget to tell you?\\r\\n On the way home from Milwaukee, my plane crashed.\\r\\n I don’t know if you saw that on CNN. I was the lady running through the cornfield.\\r\\n My hair had caught on fire because I’m near-sighted and I’d lost my glasses in the turbulence.\\r\\n I actually ran towards the explosion versus away from the explosion.\\r\\n That’s why I called in sick yesterday ’cause… my head hurt ’cause it had been on fire.”\\r\\n I fly every week, and I’ve never even thought about what if something happened to the plane until missing Malaysian Flight 370, which I am admittedly obsessed with.\\r\\n My youngest brother, who I talk to almost every day, has banned me from speaking about it.\\r\\n He goes, “Seriously, Kathleen, if you bring it up, I’m gonna hang up.\\r\\n It’s been almost two years.\\r\\n I don’t wanna hear anything that you’ve read on the Internet.\\r\\n I don’t wanna hear what you and your drunk friends decided happened to it.\\r\\n I–”\\r\\n He goes, “You’ve never been obsessed with a plane crash.”\\r\\n “Ah, ah, ah. What is the problem with that sentence, Pat?\\r\\n You just said ‘plane crash.’\\r\\n We don’t know if this plane crashed, do we?”\\r\\n That’s– That’s why I’m obsessed with it.\\r\\n About seven months ago, they found a wing of a Triple Seven in the Indian Ocean.\\r\\n That’s what that plane was, a Triple Seven.\\r\\n And they sent that wing to the French.\\r\\n I do not know why the French are in charge of science.\\r\\n I’d have given it to the Germans. But whatever.\\r\\n They actually came out and said, “Well, yeah, um, this definitely is the wing of a Triple Seven, but we cannot confirm it’s missing Malaysian Flight 370.”\\r\\n “Well, has anyone else called… Lost and Found… looking for a wing?” They found another little piece, like, three days ago. But all it says is that– It just says, “Do not step here.”\\r\\n So it could be that or a ladder.\\r\\n Who kno– Nobody– Nobody knows.\\r\\n I watched every minute of the coverage, and my brother goes, “I don’t get it.”\\r\\n I go, “Because it’s the biggest news story of our lifetime, Patrick.”\\r\\n I’m sorry.\\r\\n I’ve assumed my entire life that when we b',\n","  'ought a ticket in an airplane to go over a large body of water, I thought the whole time we were up here, someone smarter than us on the ground at all times knew where the fuck we were.\\r\\n I did. I believed that.\\r\\n Yeah, well, that’s certainly not the case. Cat is out of the bag.\\r\\n They got nothing.\\r\\n Boston to Dublin, Texas, when you get there, man.\\r\\n It gets a little weird after Nova Scotia.\\r\\n They don’t tell people that.\\r\\n As soon as you get a Guinness, give us a holler and let us know everything’s all right.\\r\\n They covered it on CNN for 72 days, and people were complaining it’s too much coverage.\\r\\n I’m like, “No, it’s not. This is wonderful.”\\r\\n ’Cause they have no new information, so now they just have to make up conversation.\\r\\n It got to the point where the experts were, like, building paper airplanes, going, “Okay, here’s what I think happened, all right?\\r\\n It was windy. Come on. Turn on the fan. Stay with me, Bob.\\r\\n Somebody put water in the trash can. That’s my ocean. Come on.”\\r\\n But I watched it, because every day they would go live to the city of Kuala Lumpur to a Hilton hotel for a press conference from the Malaysian Airlines spokesman.\\r\\n I have never felt so sorry for any individual in their job.\\r\\n Because every day he had no new information.\\r\\n And he had to face a ballroom full of Chinese people.\\r\\n ’Cause there were 239 missing people. Most were Chinese.\\r\\n Their families have been flown in. He couldn’t even make eye contact.\\r\\n He would just come out and go, “Brrrr. Ah, ha, yeah.\\r\\n Well, uh, once again, I have new no information on Flight 370.\\r\\n It’s a very bad situation.\\r\\n We cannot find our airplane.\\r\\n We have called Australia.\\r\\n They’re gonna help us look for our airplane.\\r\\n Sometimes you lose something.\\r\\n You can’t find it, and you have to ask for help.\\r\\n ‘Hey, have you seen my keys?’\\r\\n That’s the kind of situation.\\r\\n Sorry.”\\r\\n Then he would leave.\\r\\n I’m like, “This is a real airline. They’re open. Today. I check every day. I google. This is a real working airline.”\\r\\n And the Chinese people were so kind, I thought. Like in patient.\\r\\n He would come out day after day.\\r\\n There’s nothing. There was very little reaction.\\r\\n Week three he came out.\\r\\n “Ah, brrrr. Ah, yeah, once again, I have no new information on flight. We still cannot find our airplane. It’s a really, really, really bad situation. We do know this now though. We have been looking in the wrong ocean. Ha ha!”\\r\\n What? What?\\r\\n What? What?\\r\\n “Ah, yeah, that ocean wrong. Maybe now over here. We’re gonna look over here in this ocean.”\\r\\n What?\\r\\n The wrong ocean?\\r\\n That is an acceptable statement in the year 1492 regarding a boat.\\r\\n “I don’t know where it went, man. I told you the world was flat. Maybe it just fell off. I don’t know.”\\r\\n That is not an acceptable statement in the year 2014. Unbelievable.\\r\\n And once again, the Chinese people, they just didn’t really react.\\r\\n And I thought, “Oh, my God. That’s– That’s the day where my Irish temper– Every– Every single valve would have burst.”\\r\\n I could’ve had a can of Aqua Net and a lighter, and that man would have burst into a pillar of fire.\\r\\n A biblical pillar of fire on CNN International.\\r\\n And I would’ve done it knowing full well I’m gonna be arrested and tried for murder, which would’ve been fine.\\r\\n And I would say, “Yes, please let me take the witness stand.”\\r\\n ’Cause I don’t care what question I’m asked. I have a two-word answer.\\r\\n “Miss Madigan, is it true that you took Aqua Net and a lighter into the ballroom?”\\r\\n “Huh. Wrong ocean. Ha!”\\r\\n “Wrong ocean.”\\r\\n Unbelievable.\\r\\n The Chinese people, though, are still pretty kind.\\r\\n Day 72, for those of you who are not obsessed with missing airplanes, um, that’s the last day of hope because the ping device can no longer possibly operate.\\r\\n There’s the black box and then there’s a ping thing that emits a sonar sound.\\r\\n Now, this is assuming one had put batteries in their ping device.\\r\\n Yeah. Google this.\\r\\n About five months ago, they had a little secret announcement ’cause they thought everybody forgot.\\r\\n “Ah, yeah, one more thing. Ha ha. About that airplane. Um, we never had batteries in that. Yeah. Sorry. Well, you know, sometimes at home your remote control, your batteries go dead, and you go to a different remote control, and you take those batteries and you put ’em in this remote control. And then later on, you go for the other old one. You go, ‘Uh-oh. I forgot.’ That’s what happened. Sorry.”\\r\\n They are open.\\r\\n So day 72.\\r\\n At the time the Chinese people don’t know that there’s– They don’t know there’s no batteries. They believe there were batteries in it.\\r\\n He comes out, and I thought, “Whatever you do, just don’t say it the same way. Phrase it differently.” No. No.\\r\\n He came out, “Brrrr.\\r\\n Ah, ha, yeah, once again, I have no new information on Flight 370.”\\r\\n And finally, the Chinese people lost their minds.\\r\\n An old man, like, rolls back, flicked a lit cigarette at that man’s head, live on TV.\\r\\n Sadly, my first thought was, “Wow. You can still smoke inside… in a Hilton in Malaysia.”\\r\\n Note to self: Vacation in Kuala Lumpur.\\r\\n Take different airline. Check Southwest. That airline’s ridiculous.\\r\\n And then the older women started losing it.\\r\\n Like, literally, having heart attacks. 911 is being called. It’s bedlam.\\r\\n They have finally reached their maximum potential of patience.\\r\\n They’re out of it.\\r\\n I happen to be home watching it with my parents.\\r\\n My dad, who does not like public displays of emotion, was like, “Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. They got to get it together. They got to get it together. Do they know they’re on television? Are they aware that people can see?”\\r\\n My mom interrupts with– And I have six siblings.\\r\\n “Well, Jack, you have to understand it’s extra sad for the Chinese people because they only have one child.”\\r\\n I go, “Hold on a second. So are you saying, Mom, it would only be a seventh as sad if I went missing forever?”\\r\\n “Yes, that’s what I’m saying. Yes. You may not',\n","  ' wanna hear that, but that’s the truth. I mean, we have six other children. They have children. Your father and I have casino buffet tickets. We are leading a full life.”\\r\\n Yes, you are.\\r\\n Seven kids. It’s too many.\\r\\n Nobody notices though. That’s a good thing.\\r\\n If you’re one of seven, no one notices anything.\\r\\n Like, I’m surprised– I have friends who have one or two kids.\\r\\n They speak to them about their feelings and their thoughts, and they address them individually.\\r\\n ’Cause my friends are like, “Oh, you guys didn’t?” “No.”\\r\\n No. Not with seven kids.\\r\\n There were just announcements made. That’s all.\\r\\n “We’re moving.” “Oh, fuck. What? What? What? When?”\\r\\n “Your mother’s already in the car. I don’t know what’s going on with you people.”\\r\\n Nobody notices when you’re one of seven.\\r\\n Which was fine with me. I didn’t mind that. I would still choose that.\\r\\n But sometimes to the point of, “Really, guys?”\\r\\n I do not watch myself on TV.\\r\\n I was 35 years old, and I walked into my parents’ house, and they somehow had me on their TV, and I looked at it and I go, “Ah. What is wrong with my eye?”\\r\\n My dad goes, “You mean your lazy one?”\\r\\n “What?\\r\\n What?” “Yeah, your right eye.\\r\\n When you get tired or nervous, it twitches and kind of jumps around.\\r\\n You– You don’t feel that happening?”\\r\\n “No. No, I didn’t know. I didn’t know that was happening. How long has that been going on?”\\r\\n “I mean, since you were a baby. I mean, they, uh… told us to put a patch on you, but you can’t have a baby girl pirate. That’s crazy. So, uh… we thought you’d grow out of it, quite frankly, and clearly you have not, Kathleen. So if I were you, before you go on television, I would get a nap or calm down, ’cause it’s–”\\r\\n I didn’t really know how small families worked till I got to go over to other friends’ houses.\\r\\n When you’re in second grade or whatever, my friend across the street, Bob, he would say, “That’s my mom and that’s my sister.”\\r\\n And I’m like, “Well, where is everyone?” Like, I don’t wanna say anything.\\r\\n Maybe there was a house fire or, you know, some sort of tragedy.\\r\\n But this is weird.\\r\\n I think smaller families are kinder. They say kinder things.\\r\\n I don’t know if they mean them, but I heard “I love you” a lot.\\r\\n “I love you.” “love you too.” “Love you more than yesterday.”\\r\\n “Ha! Love you more than tomorrow.” And it’s not even today.\\r\\n I would just stand there paralyzed and uncomfortable.\\r\\n “You guys don’t say ‘I love you’?” “No.”\\r\\n There are nine people in my house.\\r\\n Saying “I love you” would be a sign of weakness.\\r\\n They need to wake up and wonder how I feel about their ass.\\r\\n I’m not giving them that.\\r\\n And at this age if I walked into a room and all my siblings were sitting there and they started to say “I love you,” I’d run out because I would know this is some sort of intervention, and I’m not falling for that. I’m not listening to your dumb-ass sad letter.\\r\\n “Dear Kathleen.”\\r\\n We went to Catholic schools.\\r\\n Uh, yeah, I didn’t mind.\\r\\n [man] Whoo!\\r\\n If I had kids, I would make them go to a Catholic school, ’cause I’ll tell you, the one thing I guarantee you, if you send your kids to a Catholic school, they will never join ISIS.\\r\\n Somebody would’ve said to me at age 18 after all that Catholicism, “Hey, could we talk to you about our religion for a minute?”\\r\\n Ha ha ha ha ha ha!\\r\\n “No, you may not. You are 18 years late to this party, Muhammad. You–”\\r\\n [Kathleen chuckling]\\r\\n I think being Catholic is Christian, but it’s been pointed out to me many times in the South that they’re not the same.\\r\\n ’Cause in the South, they’ll go, “Oh, are you Christian?”\\r\\n I’ll go, “Yeah, I’m Catholic.” “Oh, well, we’re Christian.”\\r\\n “Oh, okay. I thought we said the same thing, but I guess not.”\\r\\n There are differences.\\r\\n The Christians have a direct relationship with Jesus. They speak of it like that.\\r\\n “You know what? Me and my relationship with Jesus. I love Jesus. Jesus loves me.”\\r\\n It’s a direct, very solid relationship with Jesus.\\r\\n And I thought, “Wow. Really? You guys go straight to Jesus.”\\r\\n In a Catholic school, I was given a laundry list of people to contact… before, the nuns said, because otherwise I’m bothering Jesus.\\r\\n “You are gonna call these people, Kathleen, before you bother Jesus. You could start with your guardian angel. He’s got nothing to do 24 hours a day except tend to your needs. If he’s not available, you can speak to the saint in charge of the activity you’re upset about. Every single saint has been assigned an assignment. You can speak to Jesus’ mother if you’d like to. You can give Mary a shout. But you are not to bother Jesus.”\\r\\n Okeydokey.\\r\\n Even if I did something bad, I couldn’t tell Jesus.\\r\\n I had to go to confession.\\r\\n I had to get in a creepy closet with a guy in the dark.\\r\\n And then I had to tell him, and he’s gonna tell a guy.\\r\\n And I wasn’t good at confession because my dad, for many years, was a defense attorney.\\r\\n And starting in second grade, he would tell us all at the dinner table, “I want all of you kids to remember if the police capture you or anyone in a position of authority ask you questions, your response, no matter what, are ‘I do not recall, I need an attorney. I do not recall, I need an attorney.’ Ninety percent of people are in prison because they can’t keep their goddamn mouths shut. Never, ever snitch on yourself.”\\r\\n And then I would go to confession in the closet, and the priest would go, “Kathleen, have you done anything bad?\\r\\n Is there anything you’d like to tell me about?”\\r\\n [Kathleen chuckles]\\r\\n I’m not falling for this. My dad’s probably planted him here.\\r\\n I know– I know what I’m supposed to say.\\r\\n “I’m sorry, Father, but I do not recall and I need an attorney.”\\r\\n “Honey, you’re only in second grade.”\\r\\n “Well, maybe you don’t know this, Father Anthony, but 90% of people are in prison because they can’t keep their goddamn mouths shut. If you’d like some more information on that–”\\r\\n If you’re from a big family, you know you ne',\n","  'ver say anything directly to the sibling that you intend on saying something till you say it to a different sibling.\\r\\n They’ll say it to another, and then eventually it’ll get back to the sibling you intended it to say.\\r\\n I, uh–\\r\\n This year at Christmas, my brother said, “You should be on time because last year you were late.”\\r\\n And he said that our other sister said I ruined Christmas.\\r\\n I go, “Really? Did she say that? I ruined it? I’m calling her.”\\r\\n I go, “Did you say I ruined Christmas?”\\r\\n [scoffs] “Well, I might’ve. I mean, you were late. Everybody knew to get there at 9:30. You didn’t get there until 10:00. The kids were all excited. Everyone was excited. We had to wait ’cause you had to stop–”\\r\\n I go, “Okay, I agree. I was late. I apologize for that.\\r\\n But I would like to point out for the future that I think you and I have very different definitions of what ruining Christmas would be.”\\r\\n To me, ruining Christmas would be if I would’ve walked into Mom and Dad’s house with a 12-gauge shotgun and shot them in the face. I think that ruins Christmas. It ruins the rest of the Christmases after that, ’cause you can’t ever have another Christmas without going,\\r\\n “Oh, my God. Remember that one Christmas when Kathleen went crazy and shot Mom and Dad in the face? It was horrible.”\\r\\n My siblings have tons of kids. They’re everywhere.\\r\\n I don’t have any, and I’m glad I don’t.\\r\\n I don’t have the pressure of naming the kids. That’s awful.\\r\\n My youngest brother, his name is John Patrick Madigan.\\r\\n That’s my dad’s name, and that name has been in our family since 1853, circa Ireland, as far as we can count back.\\r\\n And then my youngest brother knew that they were having a boy, and he called and said, “You know what? I’m not gonna do it.”\\r\\n I go, “You’re not gonna name him John Patrick Madigan?”\\r\\n He goes, “No.”\\r\\n I go, “Well, I’ve never asked you for anything, but I would like to know when and where you’re going to be telling Dad this information, because I’m gonna bring a cooler of beer ’cause that’s how long his answer’s gonna be, Pat, and it’s gonna involve the whole history of Ireland and what’s wrong with English people and they were actually potatoes, but they never gave ’em to the people and Henry VIII. Wha– Why– Why would you pick this fight? Your name is John Patrick Madigan. We call you Patrick. His is John Patrick Madigan. We call him Jack. Grandpa was John Patrick Madigan. We call him– You can call him Fuck Nut. Just name him. This is a crazy fight, in my mind. Don’t– You’d have a better time telling Dad you’re gonna become a woman. Seriously. ’Cause Mom would smooth it over ’cause you’re the baby. Everyone in LA’s doing it. Bruce Jenner. Cher’s son.”\\r\\n I said, “Why? Why, Patrick? Why?”\\r\\n He goes, “You don’t know what it’s like to live with somebody else’s name. Exact same name.”\\r\\n He goes, “You know, I cannot get Direct TV because Dad won’t pay their bill.”\\r\\n What?\\r\\n I go, “They don’t even have Direct TV.”\\r\\n “Oh, no, not anymore. They did. Four years ago.”\\r\\n That’s how long the standoff’s been going on.\\r\\n It’s over a movie that Dad claims he didn’t rent.\\r\\n They’ve paid everything but that charge, but that charge has penalties.\\r\\n So it’s now $287.\\r\\n And I said, “Well, just pay the bill. I’ll pay it.”\\r\\n He goes, “No, I could pay it too. But I can’t pay it ’cause he won’t give me the account information. Because he doesn’t wanna pay it.”\\r\\n I go, “What was the movie, just out of curiosity?”\\r\\n He goes, “Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. And if you like to hear that speech, call him, Kathleen.”\\r\\n “Why would I rent Abraham Lincoln? Has something new happened? Do we have new information? Did John Wilkes Booth not shoot Abraham Lincoln? I never ordered goddamn Lincoln . I know it.”\\r\\n I said, “All right. Well, if you’re not gonna do that, what other names were you guys thinking of?”\\r\\n He goes, “Well, a lot. But here’s a little left-field one. Maybe Seamus.” And I went, “Seamus Madigan?”\\r\\n He goes, “Why is that funny to you?” I go, “I don’t know. But we should pay attention to that.”\\r\\n I just laughed for no reason.\\r\\n I go, “I think names have power. If you’re gonna name him Seamus Madigan, I think you should lower all expectations.”\\r\\n Seamus Madigan is a bartender.\\r\\n He always was a bartender. He will always be a bartender.\\r\\n I don’t think he’s gonna be a heart surgeon.\\r\\n And if he was, I wouldn’t let him operate on me, even if he was my nephew.\\r\\n If I was in some emergency room, they came out and said, “Your surgeon, Dr. Seamus Madigan, will be out in a minute,”\\r\\n I would be like, “No, he will not.”\\r\\n And I would wheel my ass down to the Jewish hospital, where there was a nice young man named Sam whose family took education more seriously than beer pong and football.\\r\\n That’s what I would do.\\r\\n I have no kids. I don’t– I don’t want them.\\r\\n I’ve seen what it’s done to some of my siblings.\\r\\n Oh, they’re so tired and cranky.\\r\\n My sister’s normally very happy. Has twins.\\r\\n She looks so tired. I go, “You look really tired.”\\r\\n “You don’t have to say that. I know I look tired. I am tired. I have four-year-olds. Did you know– I thought it was gonna get easier. It doesn’t. The average four-year-old asks 436 questions in a day. Did you know that? And I have two of ’em. And I’m too tired to add 436 plus 436. It’s a lot of questions, Kathleen.”\\r\\n I said, “Do you know why they ask 436? ’Cause you were dumb enough to answer the first question. That’s what led to that line of questioning. You got to shut it down.”\\r\\n If I have ’em, I’d throw ’em in the van in the morning.\\r\\n They’ll ask a random question.\\r\\n “Hey, Aunt Kat, how come their dog gets to be out front and ours doesn’t?”\\r\\n “Fuck if I know.” That’s the answer.\\r\\n Ask Siri. Siri has answers.\\r\\n Aunt Kat, no answers.\\r\\n [Kathleen chuckles]\\r\\n Here’s the biggest reason I would never wanna have a kid.\\r\\n ’Cause I will never again on my own or even assist on installing a car seat.\\r\\n I don’t know how many of you ever had to ',\n","  'do this, but if you’re gonna, here’s a few helpful hints.\\r\\n Take the whole day off work, because that’s how long it’s gonna take you.\\r\\n Whatever your favorite alcohol is, have a bucket of it next to that minivan, ’cause you’re gonna stop and have to take drinks and re-read things.\\r\\n If you’re over the age of, oh, I’d say 30, at some point you’re going to become infuriated with Ralph Nader, ’cause he’s the one who started it all.\\r\\n I remember being in grade school and he was on 60 Minutes .\\r\\n “Seat belts. Everybody must have a seat belt. Car seat, seat belts, safety is for life. Head injuries are also for life. I have statistics.”\\r\\n Well, maybe you do, Ralph.\\r\\n I’m sure you do. But so do I. There were seven of us, Ralph.\\r\\n For 16 years, we rode around in the back of a station wagon completely untethered.\\r\\n Completely.\\r\\n And we were in accidents. A lot of them. Especially if my mom was driving.\\r\\n We– Sometimes we got hit so hard, I actually flew to a better seat than I’d originally secured.\\r\\n “Who’s got the window now, jackass?”\\r\\n That’s right.\\r\\n And that was with my parents chain-smoking in the car. Both of ’em.\\r\\n It was so smoky in that car.\\r\\n You could barely see other passengers. Seriously.\\r\\n They way, way back was like Studio 54, because the sun would hit the smoke and create patterns, and then I would draw patterns within the pattern because I didn’t have an iPad, so that’s what I would do to entertain myself.\\r\\n If you’re a woman and you’re gonna install a car seat, I would highly suggest you put on a sports bra, ’cause you’re gonna get hot.\\r\\n You’re gonna be so hot, you’re gonna start inadvertently just tearing off pieces of clothing.\\r\\n And if you’re not careful, you’ll end up like I did, in my sister’s driveway in my regular bra just drinking a beer, staring off into space.\\r\\n And the normally, very friendly neighbors came home. I’m trying to talk to ’em.\\r\\n I don’t know why they’re being so weird.\\r\\n And I’m like, “How you guys doing? Yeah, I know. I just came home. She had twins. I need two of these. I can’t– can’t figure it out. I’m so hot. I’m so hot. I would offer you a beer, but I only have three left. And I’ve made no progress.”\\r\\n So–\\r\\n I just found notes on the back–\\r\\n There’s factory notes that say if you don’t know how to do this, you can take it to the police or the fire department and they’ll install it for you.\\r\\n But unfortunately, I didn’t find those notes till after I already started drinking.\\r\\n So I don’t think it would be a good idea to drive to law enforcement, shit-faced, and two car seats and I don’t have any babies.\\r\\n I mean, It’s just too much to explain, right?\\r\\n Crazy.\\r\\n So this was what I was thinking.\\r\\n I was thinking I might set her car on fire.\\r\\n No, call the fire department, and then after they put the car out, I go, “Hey, since you’re all here, do you think you can give me a hook-up?”\\r\\n [man] Yeah!\\r\\n [chuckles]\\r\\n They’re a pain in the ass, to put kids in them, especially in winter with the coats and 70,000 buckles and the whole thing.\\r\\n And my brother’s kid I thought was big enough to not go in a car seat, and I said, “Do I do him too?”\\r\\n She’s just disgusted with my lack of any parenting knowledge.\\r\\n She goes, “Ugh. 4-foot-10, 80 pounds.”\\r\\n What?\\r\\n “That’s a Missouri state law, Kathleen. If you’re 4-foot-10 or shorter, 80 pounds or less, your ass is in a car seat versus a ticket from the Missouri State Highway Patrol.”\\r\\n I go, “Really, 4’10”?\\r\\n That is excellent news because right now I’m only 5-foot-1.\\r\\n The average woman, due to osteoporosis… in your life, you would have shrunk anywhere from two to five inches.\\r\\n I am not certain. I am bad at math.\\r\\n But I’m pretty sure that puts me back in a car seat.\\r\\n I can’t wait to be back in a car seat.\\r\\n All these nieces and nephews I have will be old enough to drive.\\r\\n I’m gonna do exactly what they do. I’ll call and say I need a ride.\\r\\n Then I’m gonna pack a big bag full of unnecessary, unrelated items that I have to have, or there is going to be a meltdown.\\r\\n Then, like the five and six-year-olds, I’m gonna get in the van and walk, on my own accord, to the very backseat, and I’m just gonna hop up in it like they do and wait for the great buckling.\\r\\n Just sit there.\\r\\n [mouthing words]\\r\\n Then I’m gonna let ’em buckle me in. Then I’m gonna let them pull away.\\r\\n And I’m gonna wait till they drive where it’s somewhere terribly inconvenient to pull over.\\r\\n And I’m gonna start screaming from the back like they do.\\r\\n “My buckle’s too tight!”\\r\\n [gasping]\\r\\n “I’m choking!”\\r\\n [gasping]\\r\\n [chuckles]\\r\\n “I dropped my wine.”\\r\\n [gasping]\\r\\n “I can’t reach my wine.”\\r\\n [chuckling]\\r\\n That’s what I want to do when I’m retired.\\r\\n I just want to drink red wine and watch House Hunters over and over.\\r\\n I love that show. I do.\\r\\n I don’t know why. I don’t even care what houses these people are buying.\\r\\n I’m more interested in their relationships because at least 50 percent of the people shouldn’t even be married, more or less purchasing property together.\\r\\n I saw one in Atlanta.\\r\\n It was a man and a woman. They walked into the house.\\r\\n And the first thing out of the man’s mouth, he goes, “Ah! I can’t live with this backsplash.”\\r\\n Oh, my God, ma’am.\\r\\n You have a much bigger problem than what house you’re gonna buy.\\r\\n You have accidentally married a gay guy.\\r\\n And his boyfriend is not gonna approve of this ugly backsplash when he comes over here while you’re at yoga, aka drinking with your girlfriends on a Thursday.\\r\\n I’m just amazed to, like–\\r\\n In my whole life I’ve never punched anybody, but if I was the Realtors on this show, I would punch at least half of these people– my own clients right in the face.\\r\\n They are so demanding, and they naysay a house right out of the gate.\\r\\n They just walk in and go, “Pah! I can’t live here. There’s no granite countertops.”\\r\\n I’m sorry. Maybe you forgot. You have a budget of $8.00.\\r\\n Maybe… you should be grateful that I’m not showing you a mobile home right now and',\n","  ' bragging about the porch that JoJo put on before he went back to prison.\\r\\n What in Christ’s name would make you think you can have granite countertops?\\r\\n And it’s always the meanest lady of any episode who at some point would go, “I don’t know if I want to live here. I don’t see any room for entertaining.”\\r\\n Well, don’t worry, ma’am. No one’s fucking coming over here.\\r\\n You’re the meanest person I’ve ever heard speak English on television.\\r\\n Seriously.\\r\\n But I think over the age of 40, if that’s what I wanna do with my time–\\r\\n Over 40 you can kind of give up.\\r\\n If I just want to drink wine, why not?\\r\\n The dream catcher didn’t catch anything.\\r\\n It’s the third quarter. I’m losing.\\r\\n Just– I do understand– Over 40– I don’t understand young people that kind of give up so early where you can tell they’re just disgusted.\\r\\n They don’t want any more information. They have just had it.\\r\\n Early, like in their 20s.\\r\\n I flew to Norfolk, Virginia. I’ve never been there.\\r\\n I got off the plane. And their airport was themed.\\r\\n I’ve never seen that. And the theme they chose was mermaids.\\r\\n They were everywhere.\\r\\n They were, like, in the carpet, in baggage claim.\\r\\n They’re handing you the luggage.\\r\\n They’re just everywhere.\\r\\n And I went to the gift shop on the way out because I wanted to get water.\\r\\n There’s a girl working in the gift shop. She’s about 25 years old.\\r\\n I said, “Hey, I’m not from here. What’s going on with all this mermaid stuff?”\\r\\n And she said, and I quote, [raspy voice] “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.”\\r\\n Wow. Wow. I thought, she truly doesn’t give a shit.\\r\\n She– Bigfoot could’ve been shopping in that gift shop.\\r\\n She’d be like, “I don’t know what your hairy ass is planning on buying, but I close in five minutes, all right? I ain’t scared of you, Mr. Monster Man.”\\r\\n “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.”\\r\\n Just so disgusted that I even asked.\\r\\n But then after meeting the mermaid lady, for, like, the next three months no matter what question I was asked, that’s the only answer I would give.\\r\\n I’ll just go, “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.”\\r\\n Because it is so confusing and dismissive to the recipient, but it’s so fun if you’re the one saying it.\\r\\n My– My youngest brother, the one who won’t let me speak about Malaysian Flight 370, he helps me with my taxes ’cause if I–\\r\\n Any state you work in you have to fill out their forms even if you don’t get money back.\\r\\n He called about six weeks after I’ve met the mermaid lady, and he goes, “Yeah, Kathleen, I’m trying to do your taxes.\\r\\n I’m trying to get all these states. I think you worked in Wisconsin two times.\\r\\n You should get– They have a state-withholding tax.\\r\\n You’ll be able to get a refund. It’s a 3.8 percent.\\r\\n Ah, da, da. When you got paid, you should’ve been given some forms.\\r\\n Do you know where those forms are?”\\r\\n “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.”\\r\\n And I guarantee you, if you say that, the only thing a person will ever say back is, “What?”\\r\\n And then– [mouthing words]\\r\\n That’s what I wanna do. I wanna drink red wine and watch House Hunters .\\r\\n Uh, I don’t usually think I drink too much until you go to the doctor and they have those drinking questions on there.\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n Mine, it’s seven and eight.\\r\\n Question 7: Do you drink alcohol? A little tiny box says, “Yes.”\\r\\n Question 8: Do you drink two, four, six or eight drinks a week?\\r\\n “No.” [laughs]\\r\\n No.\\r\\n You are not even in the right ballpark. Jesus Christ.\\r\\n What is this, a Mormon practice?\\r\\n I thought the name said “Fitzgerald.”\\r\\n And I would not be judged on my deviant and abhorring drinking behavior.\\r\\n See other side, parenthesis, arrow.\\r\\n No.\\r\\n If I do feel bad about my drinking, I would come here.\\r\\n ’Cause you guys set a whole new bar.\\r\\n [audience cheering]\\r\\n Uh, or I go to Ireland.\\r\\n I try to go once a year to be with my people.\\r\\n To reset my priorities and my boundaries.\\r\\n I have friends that go to Hawaii every year.\\r\\n They’re like, “We love Hawaii, but you seem to really love Ireland.\\r\\n Do you think we would like it? Do you think they’re similar?”\\r\\n Oh. [scoffs]\\r\\n Well, they’re both an island.\\r\\n Um, Ireland, however, would have no vegetables or sun.\\r\\n I don’t know if those two things interest you, but they are fresh out.\\r\\n It is not a healthy place.\\r\\n That’s why I feel at home there, and that’s why I like it there.\\r\\n It’s sort of the gist. They just don’t really, truly give a shit.\\r\\n On a good level, in a healthy way, they’ve decided to not be healthy.\\r\\n I was in a pub. I ordered roast beef with mashed potatoes, ’cause I love that, and I thought, I’m going to ask, probably the answer is no, but I–\\r\\n The guy was like 80, the bartender.\\r\\n And I go, “Hey, do you guys, by any chance, have any corn?”\\r\\n You would’ve thought I asked for an eight-ball of cocaine.\\r\\n I–\\r\\n He goes, “Corn?”\\r\\n [Irish accent] “No, we wouldn’t have any corn here in the countryside. We probably don’t have any corn in the entire country at the moment.”\\r\\n I said, “Have you ever had corn?”\\r\\n “Yes. I’ve had corn. When I was nine, we traveled to Germany. And I had some corn and I didn’t care for it.”\\r\\n I was like, “Good for you.” He hasn’t had corn in 71 years. And he doesn’t give a shit. And he looks fine. And he’s bartending on a Thursday.\\r\\n The whole pace of Ireland is just slower. But I like it better.\\r\\n It just takes you a while in your American mind to slow down like that.\\r\\n I went– ’Cause they don’t–\\r\\n It’s very– Nobody’s really, you know, fired up on it.\\r\\n I went in a store that said “bagels,” in a little town in the country.\\r\\n I walked in. There’s a lady.\\r\\n And there’s a glass case, and there’s no bagels.\\r\\n And I thought, here we go. Right?\\r\\n I go, “You don’t have any–”\\r\\n I thought maybe they were in the back. “You don’t have any bagels?”\\r\\n “No, I’m afraid we wouldn’t have any bagels at the moment.”\\r\\n “Are you selling any other food right now?”\\r\\n “No. I wouldn’t be selling anything but the bagels, and I don’t have at the moment.”\\r\\n It’s at that point your',\n","  ' American brain wants to go, “What the fuck is wrong with you people?”\\r\\n But I would never do that ’cause I’m Midwest polite.\\r\\n I– I said, “Uh, what– Can I ask you a question? Why are you still open? ’Cause you have nothing for sale.”\\r\\n She goes, “I left the door open. First of all, I don’t know where the bagels are. They’re supposed to be here half past 7:00. It’s half past 10:00. I don’t know. Perhaps there’s been an accident on the road. You’ll say a rosary or perhaps a novena tonight for Johnny the bagel man. I left the door open in case I had a nice conversation with someone like yourself.”\\r\\n Oh, my God. I have to now go back to the other bar and order a Guinness in order to fix this conversation in my brain.\\r\\n I love Guinness. That is actually my favorite thing in the whole world.\\r\\n It’s the greatest drink.\\r\\n It’s like somebody had a beer, and then somebody threw a roast beef in the beer, and then somebody put mashed potatoes on top and handed it to you.\\r\\n [man] Whoo!\\r\\n It’s not healthy. But I really don’t care about health either.\\r\\n There comes a point in your life where you’re like, “I think it’s too late.”\\r\\n That’s why I don’t like to watch CNN because Sanjay Gupta, that doctor, comes on, and he is a buzzkill.\\r\\n Every single time he’s on, he’s got bad news about things that can kill us.\\r\\n But it’s things we’ve been doing our whole lives.\\r\\n I’m like, “Sanjay, people watching CNN are most likely over the age of 30. It is too late for us. You, sir, should be on Nickelodeon. Tell the children. Save the children.”\\r\\n It’s too late.\\r\\n I was watching it about two weeks before Thanksgiving.\\r\\n He came on. He’s like, “Uh-oh. Oh, God.\\r\\n Horrible news. Uh, World Health Organization just did a study.\\r\\n And as it turns out, they have decided that processed meats are raising the cancer rates by a much higher rate, specifically bacon.”\\r\\n [audience jeering]\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n Yeah, well, that’s right, Wisconsin.\\r\\n That’s– [chuckles] Whoa.\\r\\n I’m like, bacon?\\r\\n I’m sorry to hear that, Sanjay.\\r\\n ’Cause I love bacon. I’ve been eating it my whole life.\\r\\n Sometimes I put it in Bloody Marys. I’ve actually drank bacon.\\r\\n That’s how much–\\r\\n I added it up.\\r\\n In my life, give or take ten, I have eaten 311 pigs.\\r\\n I– I’ve eaten a farm, sir.\\r\\n You can’t fix that with a yoga class.\\r\\n You can’t back that damage up with a walk around the block.\\r\\n And I don’t even go looking for health stuff.\\r\\n I’m not that person where– No. Like the front page of Yahoo.\\r\\n I don’t know. Six months ago it said, “If you’re fair skin with freckles, uh, click here.”\\r\\n Why, I don’t want to click it.\\r\\n You know it’s not good news.\\r\\n They’re not gonna go, “Hey, guess what, freckle people. Y’all won $50. Run on down to the post office and pick up your government check.”\\r\\n No.\\r\\n But I feel like I have to click on it, ’cause it’s a meeting of my people.\\r\\n What if there’s an announcement and I don’t hear it, and I’m the only lady that didn’t know.\\r\\n Look like some sort of jackass.\\r\\n So I clicked on it.\\r\\n Google this. It’s unbelievable.\\r\\n They go, “Uh-oh. Pah, just found this out.”\\r\\n Incoming. Breaking news.\\r\\n If you’re white with freckles, fair skin, and you’ve been drinking orange juice–\\r\\n All of us, our whole lives– or eating grapefruit, they have figured out that when you go outside in the sun, because your skin–\\r\\n It’s so easy to penetrate your skin, that the sun is activating the acid from the grapefruits and the oranges, raising your chances of melanoma by, like, 27 percent.\\r\\n Yeah. So now, I can’t go outside to exercise in the sunshine.\\r\\n Or I will become activated which forces me back into the dark bar… where I can have a Bloody Mary with some bacon in it.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n [man] yeah!\\r\\n And I said to my sister, “I would– I would exercise more.\\r\\n But all I do is fly around. I’m just sitting in an airport.”\\r\\n She goes, “You should get a Fitbit.” This is what this is on my arm.\\r\\n It would work better if I charged it properly.\\r\\n But this counts your steps and your miles.\\r\\n And it’ll have your heart rate if you want to enter your food.\\r\\n It’s like this– I go, “Well, maybe I’ll do that. Maybe I’ll get addicted to seeing how many steps I get in a day.”\\r\\n So, from my iPad, on my couch, I ordered the Fitbit from Amazon.\\r\\n I paid the extra money to have it overnighted.\\r\\n So the following day, this was on my porch on my front steps, which I now know is six and a half steps away from my couch.\\r\\n And then I opened it up, and I googled it, ’cause I wanted to know how it work.\\r\\n Really? It can count how far I’ve walked, steps and speed.\\r\\n We can’t find Flight 370, but I’m not supposed to talk about that.\\r\\n Supposed to just let that go.\\r\\n But we have this technology.\\r\\n So I googled, “How does it work?”\\r\\n It works based on this motion from when you’re walking.\\r\\n And then, my Irish jackasses kicked in and I thought, but does it know if my whole body is moving?\\r\\n What if I had a glass of wine and I was going like that?\\r\\n Would it know?\\r\\n The answer is no. It does not know.\\r\\n I drank two and a half miles while watching the last–\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Thank you.\\r\\n Two and a half miles while watching the last Republican debate.\\r\\n I know I won’t vote for any politician who says this, uh, at anytime.\\r\\n If they say it. So far four of them have said it.\\r\\n It’s like a hack line they say on the campaign trail.\\r\\n I just find it so cheesy.\\r\\n They’ll go, “People, America is a place where your dreams can come true. I’m here to make your dreams come true. Wouldn’t you like your dreams to come true?”\\r\\n I’m sitting there thinking, “No. No, I don’t.”\\r\\n And the fact that you said that makes me certain you have never drank a box of wine and taken an Ambien.\\r\\n I do not want my dreams to come true.\\r\\n It was horrifying. I did it like six weeks ago.\\r\\n Here was the dream. This is the whole dream.\\r\\n I’m in Alaska, wearing a sombrero.\\r\\n It’s raining Cheetos, but I can’t move my arms.\\r\\n [groaning]\\r\\n Three and a half hours of that. No thanks.\\r\\n And then I turn',\n","  'ed on late-night TV, and that’s all the infomercials.\\r\\n And there it was, the Sarah McLachlan sad animal commercial.\\r\\n [audience groans]\\r\\n Exactly. I feel the same way.\\r\\n But I’ve seen it like 200 times.\\r\\n And do you know what I’ve done? Honestly?\\r\\n Nothing. And that’s not nice. But that’s the truth.\\r\\n I thought, why don’t I react to this?\\r\\n I can’t get an animal. I’m gone too much, but I could send the money.\\r\\n I think they say like 62 cents a day for the dog or the cat, right?\\r\\n But then I thought, “Well, I don’t know what’s going on there, Sarah, but that kid on the other channel is only 55 cents a day. So maybe your cat’s living a little large, Sarah. Or maybe the child needs a raise. I don’t know, but someone should check that before you start throwing figures like that out at night, late night when all the infomercials are on in a row.”\\r\\n And I thought, this ad doesn’t work on me because it’s so sad, I usually turn it off.\\r\\n Like, you can’t motivate people to action through the emotion of sadness.\\r\\n You need to make people angry or shocked or appalled.\\r\\n That’s what gets people of their ass.\\r\\n You don’t ever see a protest with a bunch of people just laying around crying.\\r\\n No. That’s not going to happen.\\r\\n And I thought, they need to redo this commercial to make a lot more money for the animals.\\r\\n I– This is what I’m doing late night after my Ambien and boxed wine.\\r\\n I’m thinking of how to fix the commercial.\\r\\n And I– I would call Sarah back. She seems like a lovely lady.\\r\\n Call her up in Canada and go, “We really messed up. We need you back down here, and we’re going to reshoot the commercial.”\\r\\n You pay for her to come back to America.\\r\\n You go, “Here’s what’s gonna– Here’s how it’s going to work, Sarah. We’re going to send you out to that song that you wrote, the saddest song ever written on earth.”\\r\\n ♪ In the arms ♪\\r\\n [yowling] I don’t know what the words are.\\r\\n I think it’s about that cat having pink eye, but I can’t–\\r\\n I don’t know. That one definitely has pink eye.\\r\\n It’s dangerous ’cause it’s gonna hop to the other eye like Bob Costas at the Olympics.\\r\\n It’s– It’s a mess.\\r\\n You got to put hot water on it. And cats don’t like water.\\r\\n I don’t know how you would begin to fix that.\\r\\n But here’s what’s gonna happen, Sarah.\\r\\n You’re gonna walk out to that song that you wrote. Lovely song.\\r\\n And in one hand, you’re going to be holding a beagle puppy.\\r\\n And in the other hand, you’re going to be holding a pistol.\\r\\n Remember, this is for the animals. Stay with me.\\r\\n And then I’m going to need you, Sarah, to say in your oh-so-angelic voice, without laughing–\\r\\n You have to be serious.\\r\\n She’ll go, “Hello. I’m Sarah McLachlan. If someone doesn’t come down here… in the next 45 minutes, I’m gonna blow this beagle’s brains out.”\\r\\n I would be horrified.\\r\\n I’d be like, “Can you Shazam her location? Where is she?”\\r\\n And I would drive down there, and I would take the puppy and kick the gun out of her hand.\\r\\n And where did you even get a gun? You’re Canadian.\\r\\n You’re allowed one bear gun per family, Sarah.\\r\\n That is not a bear gun.\\r\\n You guys have been a lot of fun. If you drank and you’re gonna drive, focus.\\r\\n Don’t be playing with your phone.\\r\\n I am not advocating drinking and driving.\\r\\n I’m not.\\r\\n Drinking and driving is really bad.\\r\\n And it’s really bad– I never thought about this.\\r\\n But I have a friend, who told me to say was a very handsome friend, Rick in Denver, he got a DUI.\\r\\n I never thought about this until he told me what happens.\\r\\n Now when you get taken to jail, they take all your stuff.\\r\\n That includes your phone. And they lock it all in a drawer.\\r\\n Then they come back to your cell and tell you you’re now allowed to make one phone call.\\r\\n [blows air]\\r\\n Well, that’s the problem.\\r\\n ’Cause you just locked my brain in a drawer.\\r\\n I don’t know anybody’s phone numbers by heart anymore.\\r\\n Seriously, I don’t.\\r\\n I don’t know what I– What– What would you do?\\r\\n I know the number of the house I grew up in.\\r\\n I could call that family… and hope that they were really nice people.\\r\\n “Don’t hang up. Don’t hang up. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I’m in so much trouble. I know you guys are kind of busy in Ferguson. Do you have $2,800?”\\r\\n Then I thought, seriously? They wouldn’t let you look at your phone?\\r\\n He goes, “Kathleen, you don’t get it. No, no.”\\r\\n I go, “I think that’s being stringent. You’re not a murderer. You’re not a rapist. You’re Drunky the Clown. You’ve been captured. You can’t hurt anybody. They wouldn’t even show you your contacts?”\\r\\n “No.”\\r\\n I thought, especially if I had been drinking, that’s when my jackass behavior would kick in.\\r\\n And I would say, “Okay, I’m ready for my call.”\\r\\n I let them bring me the phone, and my one call, I would call 911 from the cell.\\r\\n [chuckling]\\r\\n “Hello. Oh, yes, this is absolutely an emergency.”\\r\\n [blows air] “Well, I have been kidnapped. That’s what’s going on here. I was abducted by two men in matching outfits. And I was thrown into what I can only surmise right now is some sort of sex dungeon.”\\r\\n [chuckling]\\r\\n “No, I’m not laughing. No, I’m not laughing. My location? Well, that actually is kind of funny. If– If you would just glance down the hall. Ha ha!”\\r\\n All right, you guys, thank you so much. I’ve had a great time. Thank you for coming out.

Louis! Louis!\\r\\n [Clears throat] [Laughter] Well…\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n M-my… my favorite sex position…\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n My favorite sexual position is, uh, reverse cowgirl… But I’m on top.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Are you picturing that? It’s good. It’s really good. Nobody gets pregnant. It’s a lot of fun.\\r\\n I’m trying to learn things about myself. Um, I got a scale for my bathroom. I’m not trying to lose weight, I’m just interested in the data. [Laughter] And I did learn something, I learned this… Because I weigh myself every night before I go to bed; and then I also weigh myself on the morning when I get up and I… Here’s what I learned… I weigh two pounds less every morning than when I went to bed… And I found out why, it’s because I shit in my bed every night. [Laughter] I do… I take a full two-pound dump in bed, and then I turn out the lights and I go to sleep. Because I don’t want to sleep alone. Your needs change when you get older… At my age, a big… big pile of shit’s as good as anybody.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n I actually have a girlfriend, but we’re struggling, because she lives in France, uh, she’s French, she lives all the way over there, and we haven’t been able to see each other for a year because of the disease. I have AIDS. And, uh… [Laughter] She’s great, though, she sends me presents all the time. That’s how she keeps it going. She sends me gifts in the mail. I get something from her every week. Sometimes it’s chocolate from France or a shirt she wishes I would wear instead of things like this. And sometimes she sends something to make fun of me because she’s a little fucked up, so last time she sent me a pair of little girl’s panties. And, uh… yeah, I was like, “That’s not funny,” because these are in my house now. I can’t get rid of ’em! It’s like nuclear waste! Think of it, I can’t throw them out because I can’t have people find little girl’s panties in my garbage with coffee grounds and butter on ’em.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n And every solution I think of makes it worse, like, if I… If I put ’em in a bag inside another bag and… Layers of duct tape, wrapped in tinfoil. Or if I put him in a coffee can and I nail it shut and I bury it in the park in the middle of the night. Or if I cut ’em into tiny pieces… and throw away one piece each week in a different town. My friend tried to help me, he’s like, “Why don’t you just burn them?” I’m like, Do you understand? Even if there’s a one-in-a-million chance I get caught burning little girl’s panties… [Laughter] So I’m wearing them right now. So…\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Yep… it’s the only solution I could come up with, I wear ’em every day… And I hand-wash them. And then I dry them like this… [Blowing] Just right on the little strawberries.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Here’s the thing: men… our biggest fear in life is that we’re going to get caught being a kid f*cker, that’s every guy’s biggest fear. Even if you would never do it, every guy’s like, “That’s what’s going to happen to me, I know it.” It’s like being afraid of sharks when you live in the desert, like, “I don’t go to the ocean, but it’s going to happen.” ‘Cause it’s a fear not based in its likelihood, but in how horrible it would be if it happened. Because when they catch a pedophile, holy fuck. Holy shit! It’s brutal… Because we’re scared, we’re so scared of pedophilia because it’s here and it’s not going anywhere. That’s a fact… it’s not like there’s a finite amount of pedophiles, and, “We got the last one!” No, they keep… It keeps happening; every generation, there’s more. Some of you have kids and some of them are going to grow up, and f*ck kids, they might, you know? Okay, no, I’m… of course… Of course not yours, for some reason, but… [Laughter] They’re coming from some place. So any real solution has to start with the basic reality that there will alway',\n","  's be pedophiles. Not a great thought, I understand, it’s not an uplifting… You wouldn’t put that on a fridge magnet. [Laughter] Or on your screensaver at the office. “There will always be pedophiles.” “Hey, where’s Jim? He’s not at his desk.”\\r\\n We do… we have to start with that reality, because our solutions that we have so far don’t really work. Here is our current solution to pedophilia: We wait till somebody fucks about 10,000 kids, and then we go, “All right, you, you better cut that out.” That’s pretty much it. There is no measures for preventing it. None! We have no policy to prevent it pe… No, we’re not even just… Like a street sign. There’s a street sign for everything! “No hunting,” “no spitting,” “no skateboarding.” I’ve never seen a “Don’t f*ck a child” sign in the w… I’ve been all over the world! Not even just like a picture of a guy f*cking a kid with a line through it, so that it… transcends language barriers. I mean, try it! You won’t get most of them with the sign. But even if one out of 50 of them is like, “Oh, shit, I’m sorry, I didn’t know it was an issue,” that’s money well spent!\\r\\n There’s things that might work, and we don’t even try them. Like, is anybody working on very realistic child sex dolls? Okay, then let ’em f*ck your kids forever, is th… if that’s better! I’m so sorry… for suggesting something that might actually work. “Oh, no! Let ’em f*ck both my sons, but don’t make a doll. That would be distasteful.” The thing is that this… I’m still talking about it… This… this problem… We lose things because we won’t really face it, you know, that are important us, like the Boy Scouts. Boy Scouts… wonderful thing, being sued out of existence ’cause of all the kid fuckery that goes on. And I know it’s upsetting, because, look, here’s the thing: the Boy Scouts is a wonderful thing for kids. They go to the woods, they work together, they learn skills, they get in touch with nature. What could it be better for a boy than that? But some of those guys want to fuck the kids. I don’t think they do it a lot. It’s not like there’s just a shit-load of kids being fucked in the Boy Scouts; I think it’s mostly that they find out that the guy wants to… I don’t actually know, though. I don’t. Do you know why I don’t know? Because I’m afraid to look it up! I’ll go to prison for typing it into a Google! How do you solve a problem if you’re afraid to fucking look it up? “How many Boy Scouts get fucked on a…” [Imitating alarm blaring] “Oh, shit!”\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Every time I move, I’ve got to tell my neighbors that I looked that up. Here’s what happens… Every few years you find out there’s some pedophile-type people in the Boy Scouts and then they announce, “We got… we got ’em all, we’re good.” And then a year later, “Whoa, there’s a bunch more!” [Harrumphs] “What’s going on here?!”\\r\\n At some point, you’ve got to wake up to the basic fact that the… maybe the people who are best suited to give your kids these wonderful experiences are folks that want to f*ck them. Maybe that’s… Maybe that’s why they’re good at it. Maybe that’s… if you want that, that’s where you go. Maybe that’s just the way that goes. Who else would want to take a bunch of kids to the fucking woods?! Who wants to take your shit kid to the fucking woods?! You don’t want to take ’em! Who else would want to do that, except people that are barely containing that they want to f*ck every kid in the face? That’s why they’re good at it. That’s what makes them good at it.\\r\\n I’m not saying that all Scoutmasters are pedophiles. I might be saying that the best ones are. I might be saying that. That sounds right. So I don’t know… you have to lose the whole thing? Just tell your kids, “Some of those guys want to f*ck you, just be careful, have a good time.”\\r\\n Take the contribution from where it comes. Michael Jackson… Wonderful music, blessed us with wonderful music… Did some other things, too. What… look, what’s worse: a pedophile who makes beautiful music, or one that doesn’t? This is the choices. “No pedophiles” is not on the menu.\\r\\n So how’ve you all been enjoying living the way I already was for a couple of years before all this shit?\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Welcome to my life. Can’t work, can’t go outside, can’t show your face, gotta wash your groceries. [Laughter] ‘Cause I got cum on the groceries. That’s why I just… in my mind, that’s what it means. Maybe that’s not what you’re thinking, but…\\r\\n I have a solution for the pandemic, by the way, for COVID, I have it. This is it: We test everybody, first of all, and ever',\n","  'y time we find somebody who has COVID, you kill them. That’s it. That’s the solution. You won’t need another one after that one. That’s the final one.\\r\\n It’s been pretty amazing to be alive during this thing, during COVID, because you’re not going to see this again, and, wow, did we learn some shit. That’s really… the things that teach you in life are things you never would have chosen to do for yourself. I mean, think about your life as far as it’s been, where you had the choices, where you’re like, “I’m going to do this, I’m going to pursue this.” It all goes to shit, every bit of it. And even when it goes right, you’re like, “Why don’t I like it? It’s what I wanted. But why don’t I like it?!” Because it’s your choice and your choices are based on fear and fucking just thin, stupid, shitty hopes. But when life just kicks you in the balls and you’re like, “Oh, fuck, everything’s different now,” and you… It shows you shit you wouldn’t have looked at otherwise. That’s the great joy in it.\\r\\n And what I thought was really interesting about COVID, and still is, is that it’s the first thing I’ve seen where everyone on Earth had the same problem. Every human being on Earth had the same problem, and we never had that before. That’s why we don’t give a shit about each other, because you read, like, “Oh, there’s floods in Houston,” you’re like, “It’s fucking water!” What is it? What’s your problem? Floods… What does that? Just walk like this. What’s… what, you can’t handle some water? My basement floods… What the fuck? Who gives a shit? Like, he’s on a canoe in the street… “That looks like fun. Why is that an issue?” There’s fires in California. What… [Blows] Blow it out. What, you can’t fucking blow out a fire? Get the water from Houston and dump it on California. Fuckin’ deal with it.\\r\\n But we all had the same problem, every person from Zimbabwe to Tokyo to Newark to Honolulu, everybody was doing the same dumb shit. Every person had the same stupid fucking moment at the same… just trying to get the mask out of the well of your car door, trying to… “I got to go in Walgreen’s, where’s my fucking mask?” You try to… It’s got pistachio shells in it and pennies. Shake it… “I’m sure it’s still effective.”\\r\\n I actually like the masks, ’cause it just… Everybody looked nice. Everybody did, ’cause it’s just their eyes. Eyes are nice. You never hear somebody say, “That guy’s got gross eyes.” It’s really… we should hide these, we should keep the masks, because this is disgusting, how do we just… With no shame, “Look inside my face! Ha-ha-ha!” Spit and tongue and teeth? It’s fucking gross! Cover your mouth! Don’t…\\r\\n I’d rather look at your asshole than your mouth. I really would, I’d rather stare into your asshole than glance at your mouth. Assholes aren’t that bad, not to look at. We don’t like to think about assholes, ’cause, like, you know, the shit and the farts and the diarrhea. But that’s a small portion of their time. You ever really look at an ass… You ever really look? [Laughter] [Blowing] Mmm. Once you see it, like in nature, it’s just… it’s a little… [Squeaks] That’s all. That’s your asshole. It’s like… You know what it is? It’s just an aperture, that’s all it is. That’s your asshole. It’s like a camera shutter, that’s all it is. It’s like the opening to the James Bond movies, That’s what your asshole’s… [Imitating James Bond theme] [Laughter] [Imitates gunshot, flatulence]\\r\\n You ever go to lick somebody’s asshole and there’s a little guy with a gun in there? [Laughter] It was bad.\\r\\n But it really was an interesting social experiment, COVID, because everybody got told the same thing… The whole world got told the same thing. If you go out unnecessarily, millions will die. And a lot of us said, “Oh, I’m going out.” [Laughter] “Yeah… I’m going now and a lot.” Yeah, and millions died. Just, we’re not that different from the turtles that you’re trying to get them not to cross the fucking highway and they’re like this, “Where I fuck, I fucked over there, fuck you.” And we’re like, “Please stop!” Putting little signs up… “Don’t go!” And he’s, “Fuck you. I’m a turtle…” [Imitates splatting] It doesn’t… We’re not that different. We’re just a fuckin’ species, and we’re just rolling along. Yeah, many dying old ladies died. That’s what happened. Many dying old ladies finished dying.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Here’s the way you got to look at it, okay? We’re still making more. We’re making new old ladies. Every day. There’s a fresh batch coming, they’re going to be great.\\r\\n I was having sex with a woman once, and she was so bea',\n","  \"utiful, I was having trouble not cumming, so I pictured her face at 80 years old, and then I came immediately. [Laughter] Because she was 92.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Anyway… One thing I found very interesting was that during the pandemic, a lot of people really liked counting the dead people. That got very popular, was counting the amount of the dead and dying. “Do you know how many people… Just today! Just today! Do you know how many people died of COVID-19?!” “Just today!”\\r\\n When… why… wh… Keeping a daily tally? We don’t do this… A lot of shit going on that we don’t keep a daily tally of how many… babies were dropped in a bucket of paint. And I looked that up! I’m not kidding you. It’s 30 a day, it’s a real problem. I’m serious! A steady 30 babies a day are dropped in buckets of paint. It’s not random, it’s one guy that won’t stop doing it.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Yeah, we liked counting them, we liked counting the dead. And when it got really high, we didn’t know how to count them anymore, people trying to find different ways to express the number or take it in. Remember January? It was really b… It was 3,000 people every day were dying of COVID, so people started saying this… “This is 9-11 every day.” “This is literally 9-11 every day.” When did we start measuring deaths in “9-11s”? When did that become the new, “how many football fields long is it,” for mass death? “How many 9-11s was World War II? Can we look it up?” I know the Holocaust was 2,000 9-11s. 9-11 wasn’t that bad, it was just one.\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Only one 9-11 of people died on 9-11. That’s like nobody died that day.\\r\\n See, it’s all relative, because then you have those… Later… remember, January was really bad, January was the worst, and then in April, March/April, we all felt better, everybody’s like, “Oh, it’s way better now, it’s way better, “way better than January”… I looked it up, it was 1,500 people a day… and everybody’s like, “It’s way better than January.” Really?! It’s half a 9-11 every single day. But that’s way better. That would be like if on 9-11, after the first tower went down, you’re like, “Eh, that’s not that bad…” It’s just one. “Still got the other one, that’s why they made two.” It’s okay, it’s all right to… make fun of 9-11, it was a hoax. Uh…\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n All right. Sorry. Anyway…\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n I thought I had COVID about three times, I’m one of those idiots, I was like, “I think I have it. Can you feel?”\\r\\n I’m bad with pain too, like, the other day I hit my elbow right on that spot where if I had a gun, I’d be dead now, you know, that s… I can’t do pain. That’s why I could never be a cop. I couldn’t walk around with a gun right here. There’s 50 things a day where I’d be like, “Fuck that, that ain’t worth…” That’s my main problem, by the way, with the whole “defund the police” idea: What about people who want to commit suicide by cop? What about them? Anyway, we’ll put a pin in that, but…\\r\\n We had a lot of protests in New York, and now we have protesters that just live here. They’re not at a protest, they’re just here. I saw a protester in Washington Square Park. She had green hair and dirty legs. And she’s holding a little piece of cardboard, and it’s… with a Sharpie… It said “Abolish billionaires.” She’s standing there. And I thought, “I don’t think that’s going to do it. I don’t…” It doesn’t feel like that’s going to result… “in Jeff Bezos going, ‘What’s happening to me?'” [Laughter] Sadly, it’s going to be okay for him.\\r\\n I think that… I thought it was good how p… How young people got out there and they expressed themselves, they went out there to solve a lot of problems. Not all the problems, but some of them. They went out there to stop discrimination. Uh, not all discrimination. Just some of it, which is a weird form of discrimination. But there are groups… There are groups that are discriminated against, the… who don’t have any protesters or any people working for them. And we all discriminate against these people, like ugly people. Everybody discriminates against ugly people. They do, and it’s awful… I mean, I’d rather be discriminated against for my race than for being ugly because you might not lose a job or a promotion, but nobody kisses you on the lips, like, your whole fucking life, like, try that. This is what we say to ugly people… “We don’t like your face. Just don’t like it. So no one’s going to fall in love with you, and it’s unanimous… sorry.” And we just expect ugly people to be like, “Oh, no, I understand. I mean, sure, my head shape is no good \",\n","  'for you, so I’ll… I’ll with… I’ll go without the things that matter in life.”\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Also, overweight people… Overweight people deal with things that none of us deal with… Because I’m not overweight. There’s people… [Laughter] Who are discriminated against because of their weight. I read a story once about a woman who was 600 pounds and she couldn’t get medical care, because everything… She goes to the doctor, he just says it’s because she’s fat… everything. She’s like, “My knees hurt,” he’s like, “Yeah, my knees hurt just looking at you, what’d you think was going to happen?” She’s like, “I have chest pains,” he says, “Yeah, ’cause your organs are over capacity, so they are hurting.” She’s like, “I got shot in the head,” he’s like, “Yeah, because you’re fucking fat, somebody shot you in the fucking head ’cause you’re fat.”\\r\\n It’s a terrible story. Here’s the worst part of the story, and this is true, this is true: she needed an MRI because she had something serious; she’s 600 pounds, she doesn’t fit in the machine. Do you know what they did? They sent her to the zoo. I’m not kidding, they sent her to the fuckin’ zoo! That’s what we do for fat people… who need an MRI! “Hey, here’s your prescription… go to the zoo.” Yeah, that’s where you should go. “You should go to the zoo.”\\r\\n By the way, you know how many fat people we have in this country? About 600 trillion-billion- thousands of ’em! You know how many trans people there are? About 38. But if you’re trans and you need a restroom and it’s awkward, we’ll change every restroom! But if you’re fat and you need an MRI, you go to the zoo, you fat b*tch. Just go to the zoo. You go experience that today.\\r\\n What happens when she gets to the zoo? What actually fucking happens when she arrives at the zoo?! “Hi… Are you here to see the monkeys?” “No, I’m here for an MRI.” “Oh, shit. All right. Yeah.” Uh-Huh. Okay, just stand in the straw over here. “Yeah, you’re after the walrus who has lymphoma.”\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n By the way, why is there an MRI machine at the fuckin’ zoo?! Who was it developing that instead of a fat-human-being MRI? Who’s paying for this shit? You don’t give an elephant a fucking magnetic resonance image test! Are you fuckin’ high? That’s obscene! If an elephant is sick, you just listen. You do this thing. “Me-sa thinks she gonna die today.”\\r\\n I’m saying this out of respect for elephants, by the way, because we’re supposed to respect how they live. They don’t fucking cure their diseases. This is not their culture, this is our weird… “Let’s fix it! Oh, he’s sick!” That’s not how elephants live! An elephant in the Serengeti isn’t like, “I have a lump, I have to see my oncologist.” When an elephant gets cancer, he falls over and takes his fuckin’ turn and becomes food. You don’t put an elephant in a state-of-the-art… [Imitates beeping] What if you find cancer? What, are you going to give them chemotherapy? Think a skinny elephant with a pink baseball hat.\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n [Labored breathing] “Each day is a gift.”\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n I love animals, I do… I do. We have a weird relationship to animals… We name them and we play with them, and we kill them and we eat them, and we stuff them. And we draw them. I have a dog… I love my dog, but I don’t know my dog. We’ve never had a conversation, not one time. I talk and she just hears… [Gibberish] [Gibberish] She looks at me, I’m like, “Yes!” She’s like, “What, you don’t know what the fuck I’m think…” “Fuck you”…\\r\\n I don’t know this bitch, I have no idea what she’s thinking. I really wish I did, I wish I knew what she was thinking, it’s my biggest wish, maybe, in life, is that I knew, ’cause I know she has thoughts. I know she does. There’s no way she’s just like, “Dog.” There’s stuff going on in here. I’ve seen it. You ever watch your dog make a decision? You ever d… watch your dog just walk in the room and then look around, like… “I’m going to go over here.” Why?! Please tell me why!\\r\\n I think my dog thinks I’m insane because I look at my life through her… through her eyes, like, I’ll watch TV for four hours, and from my dog’s point of view, I’m just sitting there.\\r\\n [Sustained laughter, scattered applause]\\r\\n [Exaggerated laughing]\\r\\n “What… the fuck is he laughing, what happened?”\\r\\n My dog is my life now because my kids are grown up, my kids are in college and they’re all, you know… I’m an empty nester. That’s what you call it when your kids are gone… ’cause they grow up, not if they’re dead. It’s not used that way. “My daughter died of leukemia.” “Hey, you’re an empty nester!”\\r\\n ',\n","  '[Laughter]\\r\\n I miss it, I miss having little kids. I think about it all the time, I think about it… Maybe adopting, you know, I could adopt a baby from a Third World country. That’s a good thing to do because you can just leave ’em outside, you don’t have to…\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n You know, it’s interesting… We’ve been adopting babies from other countries in America for a long time. You know, other countries do it too, but I live here, so I’ll talk about that, but… It’s an interesting thing. It’s not a biological imperative to go get a baby from thousands of miles away, but we’ve been doing that in large numbers here for a long time, and not always for the same reasons. There’s been different reasons why we’ve done it. In the early, like, in the ’70s, when I grew up, sometimes you’d meet a couple who had an African baby that they brought because there are those kind of, you know, these kinds of people, you know, the kind of couples that hold hands when they announce things. You know those kind of people? They gather their friends and they’re like, “We’ve decided”… You know those…? They have a farm table with a clay pot of honey on it. And their apple juice is cloudy. You know what I’m talking about? Those are the kind of people that make a trip to Zimbabwe and get a baby and name him Kevin and send him to Boston College, whatever.\\r\\n That was like the ’70s and ’80s; then in the ’90s, it became very popular with gay couples, started to adopt babies from China because they want to have a baby, but they can’t… They both have dicks. I don’t know if you know that. Did you know that? Gay couples have two dicks, so they can’t make a baby. You can try. You can… This is really fuckin’… You could… [Laughs] You could try to cum into one dick with the other, like, if you line up to dick holes and you could cum, and the sperm goes up this dick and down that one. And then this sperm gets to the balls and he… and they’re like, “What the fuck? Where…?” “Did we turn around? ‘Cause we’re in the balls again.” Whose balls are these?! These aren’t even his balls! Oh, he’s gay. Fuck. All right. Okay, all right. “Well, just swim around until we’re dead.” It’s just the way it is, you’re not going to… A baby will never come out of a penis. Which is good. It’s a good thing. Because it’s hard for women. Imagine pushing a whole baby out of your penis, dickhole. Even just the hand. Yeah. Anyway, so that’s why gay couples adopt. That’s why.\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n And often from China, because they make a lot of stuff there. Uh…\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n So that was that, that was… The gay couples were adopting Chinese babies because they couldn’t have babies, and then… and then a lot of other couples started doing it more around the turn of the century. I used to live in Hollywood, which is a pretty awful place, and everybody there gets Chinese babies. It’s very popular. They go… because… And it’s not because they can’t have babies, and it’s not because they’re trying to help somebody from far away; it’s because they’re just busy; they’re busy… They want to have a baby, but they don’t want to have a baby. You know what I mean? That thing where you can’t have your baby and eat it too, or what… I don’t know how… They want to get pregnant is the point, so they go to China… They don’t even go to China, they go to the airport and somebody from China meets them, gives them a baby… it’s true. They just take it home and then they get a Jamaican nanny to watch their Chinese baby, and they go to cocktail parties. “We have this Chinese baby, it’s amazing.” And meanwhile, the Chinese baby and the Jamaican nanny are just alone, looking at each other like, “What are we doing? What is…? What is this?” Why can’t either of us see our families? Why…? “What the fuck is the point of this?”\\r\\n So, yeah, my dog, I got a dog, my kids are, eh, and I just sit around and watch, uh, watch YouTube a lot… That’s my favorite… pastime. Um… I was watching YouTube today; I was watching one of the ads that comes on before the video I wa… I don’t skip those. I think that’s rude. It is. It’s mean. Somebody worked hard on that ad. They trained a cheetah to run alongside a Jeep Cherokee. And you’re at home like, “Three, two, one… fuck off.” [Laughter] Fucking mean… what if you made something, dick?\\r\\n Anyway, the ad was a PSA. It was a, uh, anti-smoking message. It was a Puerto Rican man with a hole in his throat, he was like… [Imitating electrolarynx]\\r\\n “My father smoked. And my mother smoked. I wish I never smoked in my life. Please don’t smoke cigarettes. Cigarettes are ve',\n","  'ry, very bad for you.”\\r\\n First thought I had was, why does he still have an accent?\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n It’s coming out… Feels like if you bypass the mouth… You shouldn’t have an accident anymore. Does the machine have a setting for “Puerto Rican”? Is that just how air sounds coming out of this guy? Does he fart with an accent? [Imitates flatulence] “Senor, I’m farting!”\\r\\n Anyway, after the ad, I watched the video that I was looking for, which was a scene from a movie, and it’s a scene that I really hate… Every time I see it, it makes me angry, which is why I was looking for it on YouTube. And it’s a movie I like… I actually like the movie. It’s called Good Will Hunting, remember Good Will Hunting?\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n Of course, right? Matt Damon played… A great performance. He plays a very complicated young man w-wearing a tight T-shirt for a whole movie. And here’s the thing… Here’s my issue with Good Will Hunting… Matt Damon also wrote the movie. Okay? So he basically sat down, he’s like, “First of all, I am amazing.” [Laughter] “I’m a construction worker, I’m, like, working-class, and I drink beer and I get in fights, I get into so many fights. My friends are like, ‘You’re out of control, man, ‘ and I’m like, ‘Shut up this is the way I am.’ But then also, I’m a genius. Ooh! I’m not… I didn’t even go to school, I just know things, I don’t know why… I just know them. And all the nerdy geniuses that studied for years are like, “‘He’s so much smarter than us, it’s making it upset’.”\\r\\n It’s insane! It’s fucking insane. It only makes sense if he wrote it for himself to be the guy. So the scene I was looking for, it’s the worst example of that in the movie. Here’s what happens. He goes to a bar and he meets a woman and he likes her. And another guy likes her too. But she picks Matt Damon… because he wrote the fucking movie! Because he decided, you understand?! “She doesn’t like him, she likes me, you better believe it!” [Laughter] So he gets her phone number and then he goes outside and he sees the other guy in the window of a restaurant, and he decides to taunt him, so he goes over… He tells his friends, “Hey, come here, watch this.” And he says to the guy, “Hey, do you like apples?” [Laughter] And the guy says, “Yes.” And Matt Damon goes, “Well, I got her number. How do you like them apples?” And all Matt Damon’s friends go, “Oh-ho!” Ho-ho! This was amazing! Oh! Oh-ho, my God! Oh, my God! You were ready with that! “How?!” You know how he did it? He wrote the whole fucking movie, okay?! He made everybody say all the things. Otherwise, this doesn’t happen. I mean, he hinges the whole fucking prank on the guy likin’ apples; the guy must like apples. Who the fuck… Who would say “yes”… to, “Do you like apples?”… Coming from a clear antagonist… who’s setting him up… Gathered his friends. “Do you… Ha, wait, guys watch this… Do you like apples?” [Sighs] God damn it, I do. I wish I didn’t. ‘Cause I can tell this is not going to go my way. But I just… I can’t lie. They’ll know it. They’ll know it’s because, boy, do I like apples.\\r\\n Do you understand if he says “no,” Matt Damon is fucked. He’s fucked in the face for life. He’s got nothin’! “Do you like apples?” “No.” “D…” [Stammers] [Laughter] “What…” Dude. Fuckin’ guy. No, come on, seriously. Seriously, you fuckin’… Don’t fuckin’… Don’t fuckin’… [Labored breathing] Do… do… do… Do you like bananas? Do… ’cause I thought… ’cause the woman gave me her telephone number, and isn’t that bananas? [Laughter]\\r\\n I saw a guy… I saw a guy peeling a banana the other day. It’s another banana joked, because… Did you hear the other one ended with “banana”? Banana… I got three banana jokes, by the way. This is number two. Okay. I saw a guy peeling a banana on Sixth Avenue, and it bothered me. I’ll tell you why, because it’s the way he… When I peel a banana, I hold around here, I peel down to my hand, right? This guy holds the banana at the bottom. And he just peels the whole thing all the way down. It felt like a guy at a urinal pulling his pants all the way to his ankles. I was like, “Dude, TMI with that banana right now. What are you making a smoothie on Sixth Avenue? What are you doing?” The banana was like, “Hey!” You don’t even know how much you’re going to eat. “I have a bruise right here.”\\r\\n Kind of got lost in the banana shame there. You wanna hear the other banana one now?\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n All right. Okay, so… I was at the grocery store… and I needed bananas. So I go over to where the bananas are, and there’s a Black woman at the bananas. It’s going',\n","  ' to be okay. It’s going to be okay, I swear.\\r\\n [Applause]\\r\\n I understand. White people are very scared of discussing bananas and Black people in the same conversation. I understand… if I have a Black friend over, I would never offer him a banana. I just, I don’t know why, I just wouldn’t do it. “Hey, you want a banana?” “Why the fuck you asking me?” “Hey, man, sorry, you have an apple? I’m really sorry.”\\r\\n These are just the facts of the case. All right? I was in a store, looking for bananas and there’s a Black woman in the bananas, and I wanted to… I didn’t want to go there while she’s there because of COVID. We’re all giving each other space. So I… I… But I do want to be next. So I’m waiting. And she’s kind of takin’ a long time. And the longer she takes, the longer I’m a white man watching a Black woman choose bananas. And this is an awful thing about the world today, because I know I’m not doing anything wrong, but I feel fucking bad. I feel fucking bad. So I went to the strawberries. [Chuckles] And there’s a f*ckin’ Jew at the strawberries.\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n “Here’s a nice one!” [Laughs, clears throat] That’s the Jew. I’m not going to do the Black woman. No, not… you know why? Because I’m not afraid of Jews. That’s really… That’s the bottom line. I’m not scared of Jews. I don’t find Jews to be frightening… unless you’re in Palestine, then they’re terrifying. It’s very different. Over there, they’re like, “The Jews are killing us!” And here, we’re like, “Really? The Jews?”\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n “We’ve been slapping them around for years.” Anyway.\\r\\n “This banana’s too hard!”\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n “Well, this banana’s soft, but I’m not gon’ have it till Tuesday, so… I’m gonna buy the hard one and wait.”\\r\\n Just trying to be fair. Just trying to be fair to the Jews.\\r\\n “Lawd, have mercy.” Anyway…\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n Don’t worry, I’m an old man, I’ll be gone very soon. I worry about getting old only ’cause I don’t want to lose my memory, you know? I mean, some of it I would love to lose. [Laughter] But it doesn’t work that way. You got to take it all or none, I guess. But I lose… I forget things, you know, like, remember Fonzie from Happy Days? I don’t remember him. I don’t even know what you’re talking about.\\r\\n I forget weird things, you know? Like I was walking down the street once in New York and there was a guy in a van and he roll down the window and he said, “Hey, get in the van and suck my d*ck.” And I said, “All right,” you know, so… I got in the van and, you know, I was trying to pull the door, the sliding door, but it kept… and he’s like, “It just shuts, don’t… You don’t have to… I was like, “Sorry.” He’s like, “Everybody does that, it’s okay.” So I’m kneeling on the floor of the van on like a purse, and there’s no lady in there, but I’m like, “I came here to suck this guy’s d*ck, not, like, take inventory. I should just get to work,” so I started suckin’ his d*ck, and about halfway through… I’m guessing… I remembered… that, I don’t really like doing that.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n So, senior moment.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Some people worry about getting old because they think it means that they’re dying, which it does. But this doesn’t worry me… I don’t worry about dying because I think it’s necessary. I think it’s something that you just have to do. You should do it. It’s… when it’s your turn, you should do it. If somebody you know, your doctor says you’re dying, just say, “Okay,” and die… Don’t, you know, “May be a miracle?” Fuck you, get in the ground, just take your turn. I really think that way now… I didn’t used to, but I do, because I…\\r\\n You know when I started thinking that way was when my mom died. My mom died a couple of years ago of anorexia. She was 300 pounds. She was bad at it. [Laughter] I know it’s fucked up, right? [Laughter] Hmm. What a piece of shit. Anyway… She would have liked that joke. She would have! My mom, fuckin’, she was gross. And I remember when she was dying, I was… I was alone with her, and the nurse said, “This is… this is imminent.” I was like, “What does that mean?” She goes, “It’s… she’s going to die in a minute.” I’m like, “Just say, ‘in a minute’. It’s so close.” Anyway, I was alone with her and she died, and I was like, “Fuck, they’re going to think I did it, obviously.”\\r\\n I didn’t want to lose my mom, I really didn’t, but I… but we had this one conversation, like, two weeks before she died, when we were… We were talking about it and I said, “Mom, I don’t want you to die.” And she said, “You’ll get over it.” That’s what she said! And I did. But in ',\n","  'the moment, I wasn’t willing to accept it, I was like, “I don’t want you to go,” she said, “But we’re going in order.” Do you understand? This makes sense. I’m your mother,” I’m like, “Mom, stop talking like that. This is sad,” she goes, “No, it’s not. Look at it this way, would… Do you want me to never die?” I was like, “No, I don’t want that at all.”\\r\\n And it helped me get in touch with an important idea, which is that dying is important, it’s every generation’s greatest contribution to history is that they die. It’s the only thing that keeps things moving; it’s the only reason there’s any progress in the human race is that folks keep fucking dying. Every generation has had a mix of douche bags and amazing people and boring, great, good, whatever, but they’re all fucking dead. Every fuckin’ one. Thank God, they’re all fucking dead. There’s a limit to how much any of the good ones did, and the shitty ones got to stop being shitty. It’s a great system. Now, when you look at the Internet and all these people, you’re like, “What the fuck is happening?” They’… it’s okay. They’re all going! Every th… All of them are going to die. I mean, you don’t want to die.\\r\\n [Cheers and applause]\\r\\n You don’t want to die, you don’t want your loved ones to die, but that’s a selfish wish when you think about what would happen if nobody died… What kind of world would this be if there was no… Nobody d… If we still had people here from the 1100s? It’s hard enough having people here from the ’50s! “Sir, just scan the code on the table, there’s no menu.” “What?! I don’t understand!” Jesus Christ! You want to go through that with Pontius Pilate and Charlemagne?\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Fucking pain in the ass. Fucking old people that don’t want to fucking, just, when you get older and you start going, “Everything’s so crazy now”… No, it’s fine, just get the fuck out. It’s great. They’re not going to make it work for you, you’re here for 10 more minutes, just get the fuck out.\\r\\n If you’re in an airport and you’re looking at the toilet and you’re like, “I don’t understand how this works,” it’s time for you to die, that’s what that means. These toilets are for the next people, get the fuck out.\\r\\n That’s the way I look at my life now. I had some good, I had some bad, but I’m done. I mean, I’m… I’ll hang around ’cause I’m curious. But I’m so interested in the way things are going, I really am, it’s such an interesting time, such a… we’re on a hinge, it’s such a cool thing to experience that. I’m excited about a lot of what’s coming, there’s things that are hard now, but that’s the way it is. Things are going to get…\\r\\n I think it’s exciting what’s happening; I think young people today have some great ideas. They’re being a little cunty about some of them, but the ideas are good. The ideas are good. Like, when I was growing up, we had two genders… Male and female. Now you have all these expansion teams. I think it’s very exciting. It is! And the best idea is this gender fluid thing. This is a great fucking idea. Gender fluid, the idea, the way I barely understand it, is that you… you just… Something in the middle. It’s like a fretless bass. You don’t have to be… The specific pictures… What a dumb way to do it. “These are the kinds of people you can be, which one are you?” “I don’t feel like any of those people.” “Then you’re a failure. You have to fi… Start acting like these people so we know what to call you.” Why?! Just make it a… It’s just a… pbbt, What, just… A la carte, “I like d*cks, I don’t like balls, I’m a… this and… moving through it, changing when it feels like it.”\\r\\n I wish… what I’m saying is I wish we had that when I was a kid, because I think our generation got hurt by the rigidity of identities and how you had to just stick to them. You didn’t pick one right away. You’re eight years old, “What are you?” “I’m a… I’m a boy.” “What do you like?” “Uh, girls… Vaginas! Love vaginas!” I’m eight years old, I never saw one, but I’m committing my life to them right now. I don’t even get to smell one for a second! Just a sniff! [Sniffs] “All right, what else you got?”\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Ten years old, “Are you gay?” “No, no, no, I hate d*cks, hate ’em.” What do I know? I didn’t even get to fidget with one for a minute!\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n “This banana’s too hard!”\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n I’m not saying I wish I could have blown all my friends to see what it’s like. But on 4th of July, there were fireworks, I was with Matt, there was a feeling… I don’t know what could have happened. I have no idea… Because we were so scared',\n","  '. We were so… We were afraid to seem gay when I was a kid, ’cause in the ’70s, the stereotypes showed you what everybody is like. [Deep voice] Men are like this. [Falsetto] And then the women have to act like this, and then gay people are like… they’re just tired. That was gay people in the ’70s. “I’m gay. Help, I’m gay, I can’t even do anything.” That’s what gay men were in the ’70s.\\r\\n You ever meet a gay person? You don’t fuck with gay people, not today. They’re all athletes, first of all. And they… they got their shit together. They’re fucking… their motherfuckers, gay people. Your landlord’s gay. They’re billionaires! They own Apple. They’re in the cabinet, they’re in the Navy. They’re… they’re… they’re cowboys and Indians and construction workers. Gay men are men. You ever go in a gay-owned business? He’s like, “Can I help you?” Like, the gay’s in there, but he’s fucking tough now. “This is my store, motherfucker, what do you want?” Gay men are men now. They’re… they’re fathers, they’re husbands, they’re men. Today’s heterosexual men are f*ggots. I don’t know how that happened!\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n And I… but they’re f*gs!\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n I’m saying that with love and as an old man on his way out the door, but they’re fucking f*gs! They’re intelligent and they’re evolved, but they’re f*gs, with the pajama shorts?! And the… just pale, almost blue. “Mm, my wife got a promotion today.” Oh, good for you, f*ggot. I’m so happy. I am! I’m happy for him! Sounds like a good… They have a good life together. But it takes some getting used to for me… When I see a progressive young couple, I always want to stop them and ask her, “Is that turning you on? Please tell me, is that sexy?” He… with the Tin Man’s hand pipe, just… Strawberry smoke. “Pbbt!” She’s like, Well, he’s very intelligent “and he’s conscientious”… But does he make your p*ssy wet? “Fuck, no, he’s a f*g. But I love him.”\\r\\n And again, great, it’s another kind of dude, “f*ggy straight dude,” it’s another kind of guy. Welcome! We should have all of it, the whole spectrum, the whole alphabet, all of it. But somebody does have to be just a straight fucking. You have to have that. It doesn’t have to be the most important, but you do need it because it’s where it all fuckin’ comes from. Until they figure out some other shit, this is where life still starts. If… if you want to eat local and organic, you got to respect that someone’s got to have a hard d*ck f*cking a p*ssy. That’s… that’s where every trans, every gay person, came from… two boring straight people f*cking. I mean, that’s just… for now, it’s… someone needs… You could… With an original d*ck, not a turned-inside-out p*ssy wrapped in thigh flesh… Which is wonderful! Wonderful! You got to respect that! You do! Somebody who wants to be themselves so bad they rip their balls off… That takes balls to do that. It does! Fuckin’ respect! But someone’s got to have a factory d*ck with matching numbers, fucking a wet, farm-raised p*ssy.\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Thank you very much. Good night, everybody.

Gosh, that’s way… Come on, now. Please. That is… That is so nice. Keep going forever.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Look at this. Here we are. London Palladium. My gosh.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n Thank you so much for coming out. Oh, my days. Oh. Let me put this away. The biggest stage in the world so I’ll be back in about half an hour.\\r\\n Guys, thank you so much for coming out tonight. I really appreciate it. Here we are. It’s taken a few more months longer than expected, but here we are. Look at this, a sold-out, reduced capacity, London Palladium!\\r\\n [laughing and cheering]\\r\\n Oh, my gosh. Oh, man. Thank you so much for coming.\\r\\n So we were meant to film this last year. We were meant to film this in May of 2020. But something came up. We had to push it back. But we made it. Here we are. We’re finally doing it. I can’t wait to do the show. I hope it is all still relevant.\\r\\n This show is about Brexit and how much I want to meet Prince Philip. Let’s go! Let’s do it! Should be good, should be fun.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’m Phil Wang, in case you didn’t know. Here I am. Old Philly Philly Wang Wang. Here at last. Old Philly Philly Wang Wang at the London Phalladium.\\r\\n So good to be here. Phil Wang. Uh, I’m a mixed race fella. As the name “Phil Wang” might suggest. At some point here, a cultural compromise was made. Yes, well, my father is a Chinese Malaysian, hence the “Wang.” And the rest of my body. My father is Chinese Malaysian, uh, but my mother is, uh, normal. So, yeah, got some sour cream in that chili.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Didn’t want you to burn your tongue on that hot Wang, so Mama brought the milk.\\r\\n White and Chinese, those are my races. White and Chinese. Phil and Wang. White and Chinese. I’m the most powerful race on Earth! I got the big ones, baby! Smoosh them together. I’m white and Chinese. People have tried to tell me that I’m a minority.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’m like, “I’m both majorities, bitch. I’m white and Chinese.”\\r\\n [laughing and applauding]\\r\\n You can’t touch me. I’m Pepsi and Coke. I’m like a full market share. They sell Wang everywhere. I’m white and Chinese. I’m everywhere. You can’t run from me. I’m around every corner. Hello. Ni hao. I’m Alien and Predator. I’m white and Chinese. I’m future-proof, baby. Completely future-proof. No matter what happens over the next 50 years, Wang, or Phil, is fine.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Probably Wang, though.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n The way things are going.\\r\\n It’s weird looking like me at the moment. In the wake of the COVID pandemic, it’s weird looking like me. Uh, Chinese, not muscular. It’s weird looking Chinese at the moment. This whole pandemic, it’s been bad for the brand, to say the least. Honestly, the last thing we needed, especially in the UK. The last thing East Asian Chinese Brits needed. East Asian Brits, East Asians in Britain, very low profile in the UK. So low, in fact, that we don’t even have the word “Asian” here. Most places in the world, we at least have the word “Asian.” Not in the UK. In the UK, the word “Asian,” usually refers to South Asian, right? Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi. Which is fine. But there’s this whole other half of Asia they’re missing out on. A whole other, I would say, bigger half.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n There’s a whole other half of Asia missing out there. There’s two types of Asian in the world. There’s more, but I don’t have that much time. Fundamentally, there are two main categories of Asian in the world. There’s Cricket Asian.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n By the sounds of it, you already know who those guys are. You’ve never heard “Cricket Asian” in your life and instantly you knew who I was talking about. So there’s Cricket Asian, and then there’s Eats-Weird-Shit Asian.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now, I am a member of Eats-Weird-Shit Asian. I’m a proud Eats-Weird-Shit Asian. I eats that weird shit. But it’s kind of awkward being an Eats-Weird-Shit Asian at the moment ’cause that’s how this whole catastrophe started in the first place.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n One of us ate one piece of weird shit too far. After centuries of living on the wild side, we pushed our luck and it finally snapped on the wings of a bat. It’s awful. Why now? It’s always been fine up till now. I ate weird shit as a kid. Nothing like this ever happened. Growing up in Malaysia, I was eating weird shit. Loved it. Loved eating weird shit. I would eat, like, uh, squid jerky. [growls] I was eating little wriggly sea snails, straight out of the shell. Mmm. I was eating jellyfish. I was eating pig intestine soup. Uh, we’d eat the whole fish for dinner. Whole fish. My',\n","  ' little sister would go, “Shotgun, the eyes!” Me and my other sister would be like, “Naw!”\\r\\n It’s just a different culture out there. In the West, people are a little squeamish about the more extreme ends of the culinary spectrum. Out in the East, there’s a sense of delicacy to the strange. Nowhere more so than China. China itself. I got to see this firsthand in China recently. Went there for the first time. China. The big C. Asia Classic.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Chinatown Plus. China. At the start of 2020, I got to go to China. Unrelated, it wasn’t me.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n Awkward timing, in retrospect, but it wasn’t me. I got to go to China for a job, and while I was out there, I got to go to a food market. Not sounding good, I’ll give you that. I got to go to a food market out there in China. And they were selling all sorts of Chinese snacks. There’s stalls selling noodles, some selling buns, blah, blah, blah. But there was one stall that was dedicated to weird pieces of shit. Critters, essentially. Deep-fried, roasted critters. Bugs. Locusts. There was a lizard, on a stick, just dried like: Crucified lizard, like this. People would walk past and go, “Oh, I’ll have the Jesus lizard, please.” Uh, “One Passion of the Lizard, thank you.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n There were snakes curled up like sausages with a spike through them. I partook, sure! I ate a full tarantula on a stick. Like that. Tried to do it in two halves, surprisingly tough, tarantula. So I had to just down it in one. Like a legend.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I ate a centipede. Good thing about a centipede, plenty of drumsticks for everyone.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I ate a couple of roasted cockroaches. But they’re resilient, cockroaches. Crawled out of my butt. They’re gonna inherit the world.\\r\\n It’s just a cultural thing. A cultural difference. Like, in the West, you know that nursery rhyme, I know an old lady who swallowed a fly I don’t know why she swallowed a fly Perhaps she’ll die It’s a banger.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n And in this nursery rhyme, this old lady goes on to eat increasingly large animals to catch the previous animal she ingested, which she now regrets having inside her. First she swallows a fly, by accident. Then she swallows a spider… I know what that’s like.\\r\\n …to catch the fly. Then she swallows a bird to catch the spider, then a cat to catch the bird, then a dog to catch the cat, then a horse to catch the dog.\\r\\n Now, in the West, this nursery rhyme is a cautionary tale…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …about how sometimes the solution can be worse than the problem. In China, this is a Michelin star tasting menu…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …with an admittedly heavy dessert, horse!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Oof. “We’ll just have the one. Two spoons, thank you.”\\r\\n It’s just a cultural difference. But no reason we should get that there racism because of it. That there COVID racism? I don’t want that there COVID racism, no thank you. I’m terrified of that there COVID racism. I don’t want to get that on me. Terrified. Even at home alone, “Oh!” I hear a noise, I’m like, “Racism?” “Did I leave a window open? Did racism get in?”\\r\\n Just me and my devices at home, alone… Even my devices I don’t trust. My devices are racist now. My phone especially. I think my phone is definitely racist. I was on my phone the other day, and I typed the word, uh, “Nazis” into my phone, right? You don’t need to know why.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I typed the word “Nazis” into my phone. All lowercase, right, n-a-z-i-s, all lowercase. I was in a hurry. You know what sexting’s like.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You gotta be quick. The vibe’s not gonna last forever. So I typed into my phone, n-a-z-i-s, all lowercase. And then instantly, my phone autocorrected it to replace the “n” at the beginning with a capital “N” as if to say, “Oi! Show some goddamn respect.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Those are Nazis you’re talking about… Phil Wand.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I got a far-right phone that thinks I’m a creepy magician. Terrible.\\r\\n Scary times. Not the scariest times we’ve lived through. Not really the most dangerous times we’ve lived through. But it’s the abstract nature of this new danger that has driven us insane. It’s so abstract. It’s an invisible virus. So abstract, some of us don’t even believe it’s real. Threat and danger have become more abstract as the 21st century’s progressed. With it, we’ve been becoming more insane. At the start of this century, threat and danger were very real, physical, tangible things, you know? After 9/11, War on Terror, back then, the threat, the thing that we were all told to look out for was just a guy, covered in bombs… who would come in and go: [yells] “I’m covered in bombs, everyone! I’m covered in bombs and I love it, to be frank!”\\r\\n [laug',\n","  'hs]\\r\\n We’d see him and go, “Okay, I’ll stay away from that guy.” Problem solved. Clear, tangible threat.\\r\\n Then threats started getting abstract. The next thing we were all told to look for was unattended packages. Remember unattended packages? I long for the day of the unattended package. We were obsessed with unattended packages for a while. Mid-noughties, golden age of the unattended package. All we cared about back then, unattended packages and Malcolm in the Middle. Now there were just packages out there. There wasn’t even a guy involved. Now there were just packages out there, and it was down to us to assess each one’s level of attendance.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Responsibility had shifted onto the public. We all still had our lives to live, but now we’d been burdened with a new unpaid second job of being bag spotters! We’d try our best, but it was terrifying. We’d go out, living our mid-noughties lives, down the library or the cyber cafe…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …and from time to time, we’d see a backpack just lying on the ground. And we’d freak out! We’d go, [yells] “It’s a package!” “And it’s unattended!” “Quick! Someone attend it!” Then someone would run over, [panting] we’d be like, “Phew. That was close.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But then threat got more abstract still. Then with the Internet, as life moved online, the thing we were told to look out for were bots and hackers and Russians. Then we found out none of them could tick a box that says “I’m not a robot.” That seemed to solve the problem.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now with the coronavirus, threat is the most abstract it’s ever been. Now threat is like a surface.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n “Be careful of a surface, everyone.” “No, you should be fine, as long as you steer clear of them surfaces. They’ll get you.” Awful to find out, home alone, watching the news. “Oh, shit, surfaces!” I did a quick scan of my flat. Fucking surfaces everywhere! Death trap, that place! Didn’t realize I was living in Saw III.\\r\\n Even now I’m terrified. My friends are like, “Wanna come over, have dinner in the garden?” I’m like, “Uh, maybe. Could you check quickly… Do you have any surfaces over there?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n What are we having dinner on? A table? Are you trying to kill me? You’re out of the bubble, buddy.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Scary times, man. I’m getting more scared. Getting older. Maybe you get more fearful as you age. Getting older. That’s scary itself, getting older. Holy shit, I thought I’d at least have this year off. No. Older again. So fucking old now, man. I became so old this year. Don’t know about you guys, but I became older recently. Became so old this year. Broke my personal record, actually. Became so old. I turned 31 this year. Bleh!\\r\\n [jeers]\\r\\n I know. Disgusting. Yes, you’re right. I’m gonna be sick. Bleh! So old. Thirty-freaking-one. I went into lockdown 19 years old. Now I’m 31. Terrible.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Awful. So fucking old. Thirty-one. This shit’s nearly over, folks. This is my farewell special, by the way. Oh, my God. Knockin’ on hell’s door over here. I’m 31. I’m so old. Uh, this may annoy some people.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I come onstage and I say, “I’m 31, I’m so old.” There’s always a couple of people in the crowd, like, “Oh, 31’s not old. Oh, shut up, 31’s nothing. You’re a baby. Turning 31. Pfft. Give me a break!” But they’re always really fucking old, so…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Doesn’t make me feel better.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n They’re like 43 and shit. I don’t care.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Forgive me if I take no comfort from the jealous face of death itself. Mr. Magoo and Maggie Smith think I’m a spring chicken. Oh, great.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I know 31’s not, like, “old” old. But it’s not “young” young anymore either. It doesn’t fizz with the excitement of the twenties. Thirty-one’s a pretty serious age. One of the first serious ages. Life starts to ossify at 31. Shit starts to get serious. People start committing to things long-term. I’ve got to that age now where all my friends have started having, uh, podcasts.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n So I had to have one too, to keep up with the crowd. But I wasn’t ready.\\r\\n My body’s falling apart. Body’s giving up the fucking ghost, man. Crumbling into a disgusting paste, this body. Awful. Gets worse and worse every day. Every morning I wake up to a new leak on this ship.\\r\\n It doesn’t even make sense anymore, the shit that goes wrong with my body. It used to make sense. Back in the day, I’d stub my toe, then my toe would hurt. It was a clear line of cause and effect.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now, my body skips the first step. Just straight to pain, unexplained. I just go, “Oh, why?” And my body’s like, “Fuck you, that’s why.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n It’s improvising now, my body. It’s gone full jazz. ',\n","  'Doesn’t have to make sense at all. Like, the other day I woke up, and one of my balls hurt. It just hurt. I didn’t do anything to it. I didn’t deserve that. I didn’t go to bed the night before like: [sighs, then grunts] Now I’m relaxed. I didn’t do that. But still, just one painful ball in the morning. Just exhausted by a long night’s sleep, I guess.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’s where I’m at now. Tired by rest.\\r\\n I’ve got a bad back. Thirty-one, back’s a-crackin’. My memory’s not what it used to be. Or maybe it is. I have no way of knowing.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Maybe it’s the same and I forgot.\\r\\n My farts are disgusting now. My farts are so bad. I thought my farts were bad before. Pfft. Ha! If only young Wang knew…\\r\\n ♪ What fragrant days he lived in ♪\\r\\n ♪ I should have savored them While I had the chance ♪\\r\\n Ah!\\r\\n Now my farts are revolting.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Absolutely disgusting, my farts now. They’re quieter now, I’ll give them that. My farts are quieter now. But they’re worse. For you.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n My young farts were loud and ostentatious. But, ultimately, kind on the nose. They weren’t interested in hurting anyone, my young farts. They were in it for the show, really, my young farts. They were like fireworks, my young farts.\\r\\n [mimics fireworks]\\r\\n Then Chinese people would come. “Yeah.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Good luck. Good luck for the coming year.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now my farts are like the silent leaking of an abandoned chemical factory. Just slowly poisoning the groundwater.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Killing the local dogs. It’s terrible. Terrible, my farts are. They’re absolutely disgusting, so bad.\\r\\n Have you ever done a fart so bad that you, uh, lost a bar of Wi-Fi?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I swear the other day… Swear to God, I was at home and I let one rip and [blows raspberry] Netflix got blurry for a bit. You know when it’s like, it gets the squares. “Come on!”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Body’s changing, I guess. Body’s changing. Thirty-one, my body’s changing. My mind’s changing. My soul’s changing. My personality’s changed a lot. My opinions. My political persuasion’s changed. So much from a couple years ago. I used to think I was a Socialist. That was me. Just a couple of years ago. Little Philly Philly Wang Wang with his red cap on.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n “Mm! I’m a Socialist. Boo-boo-boo. A little bit for everyone. It only seems fair.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Boo-boo-boo. Nationalize the sea. Oh, I’m a Socialist.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But looking back now, I realize I just didn’t have money.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I have money now. I’m not sharing that shit! That’s mine! Back off, you dirty Commies!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Wang made that pound.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Turns out capitalism’s okay when you got, uh, capital.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n The clue was in the name the whole time.\\r\\n I just want to be rich now. I used to want world peace and now I just want to be fucking minted.\\r\\n And I know that’s not a very meaningful pursuit, money for its own sake. But honesty is a meaningful pursuit. And if I’m being honest, I just want to be loaded. I just wanna be rich. I mean, I’m already rich. We’re all rich, technically speaking. By global standards, everyone in this room is fucking Bezos. Everyone in this room is Nebuchadnezzar by global standards. I don’t give a shit about global standards. Have you been to the globe?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n The globe is filthy. We don’t live in the globe. We live in the UK. On the edge of the world, looking in, tutting. I don’t wanna be globe-rich. That’s like 10 pounds. I don’t wanna be globe-rich. I wanna be proper rich. I want to be UK rich. And not just for the big, obvious things. Not the cars, houses, killing people and getting away with it.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’s all lovely, sure. But it’s the little things that I want to be rich for. The little touches that make being rich wonderful. Like, I wanna send a bottle of champagne across a restaurant to an acquaintance who hasn’t noticed I’m there yet.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Mwah!\\r\\n That’s some sweet rich-person-only shit. I’ve seen that in the films and Wang wants in. They’re over there, all sad on their own, eating their fish, and they ain’t got no champagne. Out of nowhere, the waiter pops up. “Oh, this is from the gentleman over there in the rabbit onesie.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’m rich! I can wear what I like! You’ve not seen opulence till you’ve seen a full-grown man doff an ear…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …across a crowded Bella Italia.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Mm. Mwah! Ooh, la, la. It’d certainly impress my date.\\r\\n I’m back on the dating scene now.\\r\\n [whooping]\\r\\n Single once more. Ah, yes.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Single fella, single now. Broke up with my girlfriend. Great way to become single. Highly effective, it turns out. So once more, dating. Dating too much, man. Dating',\n","  ' way too much. Dating too much. Dating far too much. Chasing my tail with all the dating. Running in this mirage of happiness that keeps receding further into the horizon. I’m trying to make up for something with all this dating. I’m trying to make up for what I perceive to have been a rather, uh, sexless youth. You know? I mean, not childhood. Probably for the best, whatever.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But later. Like late teens, early twenties. That time in your life when you’re supposed to get it out of your system. Just get on your knees, batten down the hatches and just fuckin’…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Just experiment! Fucking yeah! Just fuck your way to clarity.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Move on, get a job, buy a sensible hatchback.\\r\\n I never did that. I never made the most of those opportunities. University, the big one. I didn’t really have sex at university. Uh, for religious reasons. Uh, God hates me.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’ve been trying to make up for it. I’ve been trying to pay back this sexual deficit I feel I incurred. This sexual debt upon which I have imposed my own rate of interest that I cannot keep up with. Deep in with the Wang Bank over here.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Sure, the occasional repayment is fun enough, but it’s not a tenable way to live.\\r\\n I’m on the old dating apps too. On the old apps. Gotta get on the apps. That can be a depressing venture. I discovered pits of desperation I did not know I was low enough to crawl into, on the dating apps.\\r\\n Like, have you ever swiped right on a group photo…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …not knowing which one of them it is, just, “Yeah, any of them. Yeah, whatever. I’ll date anyone who can afford that ski trip.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n There’s a Labrador in there. “I’ll take the dog, whatever. He’s got a healthy coat.”\\r\\n Beggars can’t be choosers, I suppose, and East Asian guys, we have a difficult time on the dating apps. This is a documented phenomenon. East Asian men have the hardest time on dating apps of any group. In the West. I think in, like, Korea, they’re fine.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But in the West, East Asian men, Chinese men, we’re rarely considered viable, sexual options. It’s not how we’re portrayed in public culture, in media. We’re never really the sexy guys. Usually we’re portrayed as these sort of gormless, bucktooth fools who are primarily asexual. Like, completely uninterested in sex. Which is mad, considering how many Chinese people there are.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n 1.4 billion people, that’s with the one-child policy. We fuck so good they had to give us a rule.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [applauding and whooping]\\r\\n No one else got a rule.\\r\\n But still, you know, these negative perceptions persist. But I understand. I’m not angry about it. A culture’s aesthetic tastes, its beauty standards, are a difficult thing to shift, informed by many things. What a society finds beautiful is informed by its own cultural makeup, it’s informed by its literature, its language and its poetry. And sometimes I think the English language just isn’t equipped to fully appreciate East Asian male beauty.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n For example, we have very dark eyes, right? East Asian guys have very dark eyes. Some of us have very dark eyes. Some of us have black eyes. Coal-black eyes of a snake.\\r\\n I don’t know if you’ve tried, but it’s very difficult to be romantic, in English, at least, about black eyes. If you have blue eyes, green eyes, good for you, that shit’s easy.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n “Oh, you have green eyes! Like the purest emerald. Oh! Oh, you have blue eyes. When I look in your eyes, it’s like I’m swimming in the ocean. Oh!” Whatever.\\r\\n Black eyes. What can you say about black eyes? “Oh, you have black eyes. They remind me of death.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n They are like the endless abyss. When I look in your eyes, it’s like I’m closing my eyes.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Still, I guess I do all right. Um… I’ve dated some lovely ladies. Got no kids to show for it, as a bonus. No kids. No-child policy over here.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I don’t have any kids. My ex, she was on the old contraceptives. Yeah, a couple of fans in? Big fan of the contraceptives. Grateful to my ex for being on contraceptives. Grateful to all you ladies, for being on the old contraceptives.\\r\\n [women whooping]\\r\\n Thank you very much, yes. On behalf of the fellas, cheers.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Appreciate it. You’ve been taking one for the team for a while. Not gone unnoticed.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You’re doing great work. Keep it up. And it’s not fair that you ladies have to do most of it still. ‘Cause it’s not like male equivalents haven’t been developed. They have! We just haven’t told ya.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n We’re sneaky like that, us guys. It’s why you love us. They have. They made a male pill a couple years ago. They came ',\n","  'up with a contraceptive pill for men. But the test subjects found that it actually sort of altered their body chemistry. Made them feel a bit sad.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n So they all went… “Hm… Must not be ready yet.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Women can keep using their pill, which we presume is perfect by now.”\\r\\n A mechanical solution was developed for the guys. A little cork device that they just… Right there. Right there. The equivalent of the coil. Right there. Cork and the Coil. There’s a kids book. Right there. Just a little cork they put right there. Brute force approach, it worked. Right there. A little cork they put up there in the tube. It’ll just sit up there and stop the swimmers getting through. Just like a hard border. Right there. Just like putting a difficult immigrations officer up inside.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n “These passports are expired!” They’ll have to swim back and: “Aw…”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I do quite a good sperm impression. I don’t know why. I’m half sperm. Yeah.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Uh, dad’s side, if you’re wondering.\\r\\n But again, men found that procedure a little invasive, so… They went, “Uh, women can keep using the implant for now.”\\r\\n It’s not fair. It’s not fair, ladies. I appreciate that, and, men, we should help. We should help carry that burden. Share the load. Pardon the pun.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But there’s an intractable problem with male contraception. Which no one in the industry seems to be talking about. An intractable problem with male contraception, which is that, even if a guy were to get these things done to him, with the best of intentions, what woman is going to believe him?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Right? There’s a lot of trust that goes with unseen contraception. A lot of jeopardy. None of the jeopardy falls on the man’s side. You know? A lady gets pregnant, she deals with it. The guy, he can just fuck off. I mean, you shouldn’t.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You shouldn’t, fellas. You shouldn’t. But you totally can. But you shouldn’t!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You mustn’t… Don’t! But it’s very easy. But you shouldn’t! But you must refrain. But flights are so cheap now. But you shouldn’t!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You can get the Belgian passport on the dark web. Know that? Full Belgian passport.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Different name, new address. But you shouldn’t! But the option’s always open to you.\\r\\n If you’re a lady, you gotta deal with that shit. The guy, you don’t really. Which is why we don’t need convincing a lady’s sorted out with contraceptives. You can make shit up, ladies. Have fun with it. Could be like, “Oh, yeah, a magical squirrel put a curse on me once, and, uh, now I cannot bear child.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n And even a smart guy would be like, “Yeah, I think I read that. Yeah, sure. Let’s do it.”\\r\\n It doesn’t work the other way around. Say all these male contraceptives come on the market. I go down to the clinic. Get tooled up. And I go out on the town. Take it for a spin.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Then I go to a bar, chat up a girl. She’s into it for some reason. Maybe she’s sick.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n We go back to my place. We start kissing. Sure, why not? It’s 2021, keep up. We start kissing. We get a little bit less-than-clothed. A little nakey-nu, as they say in France. And… just before we get down and dirty, she goes, “Ooh, you have any protection?” And I just go, “Don’t worry, baby. Wang’s on the pill.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Who, me? I got a cork in my balls! I know you’ve never heard of it, but trust me! The man you met at All Bar One.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I got a cork in my balls! Put ’em in the sink. They’ll float, you’ll see.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’d never work. I need a doctor’s note from the UN for that shit! I’d need Malala to sign it. “He’s got a cork in his balls. I am Malala.”\\r\\n I’d love a cork in my balls. You kiddin’? Oh! I’d love a cork in my balls! London Palladium, if you take nothing else from this show… And you won’t.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …please remember Phil would love a cork in his balls! Can you imagine the peace of mind that must come with having a cork in your balls?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Oh! I’d just swan about town, making love, not a care in the world with a cork in my balls. When I do meet the one and want to settle down, I just pop that shit like champagne.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Across a crowded Bella Italia.\\r\\n [laughing and applauding]\\r\\n Thank you.\\r\\n Love a… I’d love a cork in my balls. I’d love a cork in my balls. I would absolutely love a cork in my balls.\\r\\n I wouldn’t want the pill. I don’t want to be on the male pill.\\r\\n I don’t want another thing to remember to do.\\r\\n I got enough shit in my routine. That’s the most impressive one, the pill.\\r\\n I’m in so much admiration for women on the pill.\\r\\n That’s the most badass one. It requires the most of you.\\r\\n The discipline. ',\n","  'The determination.\\r\\n The strength of character.\\r\\n The memory, just the memory!\\r\\n You have to remember to do it every day. It’s gotta be hard.\\r\\n No matter what, you gotta remember every day.\\r\\n It’s gotta be difficult. Especially if you’re not getting any at the time.\\r\\n Brief moment of candor, ladies,\\r\\n but that’s gotta be a kick to the old soul there…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n if you’re a sister going through a dry patch…\\r\\n and you still gotta pop the old sex pill every day.\\r\\n That’s a bit of a taunt, isn’t it?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Every day. Think of what that is. If you’re not having sex at the time,\\r\\n being on the contraceptive pill, that is a daily,\\r\\n oral reminder\\r\\n of your own squandered sexual potential.\\r\\n Every day just a gulp of loneliness with breakfast.\\r\\n [groans] Every day.\\r\\n Only women are emotionally strong enough to persist with something like that.\\r\\n Can you imagine if guys had to do anything like that?\\r\\n We wouldn’t last a week!\\r\\n Can you imagine if guys had to get up every morning, just crawl out of bed,\\r\\n and just strap on a condom every morning?\\r\\n Just like… [whimpers]\\r\\n “Maybe today.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Hopefully. [whines]”\\r\\n Just rolls it up his flaccid penis.\\r\\n [whining]\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Pulls up his trousers and goes to work with his condom on.\\r\\n [groaning]\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n It rides down all day like a tube top. He’s gotta keep pulling…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Distracts him at work. [groans]\\r\\n “Andy, are you all right?” “Sorry, it’s just…”\\r\\n “You’re fired.” “Oh, no.”\\r\\n He goes out clubbing that night. “Yeah. Oh, no.”\\r\\n Tries to chat up a girl. “You look nice.”\\r\\n “Ew, gross. Fuck off.”\\r\\n He has to go home alone.\\r\\n Up to his bedroom.\\r\\n “Not today.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n He just peels off this dry condom.\\r\\n Staples it to that day on the calendar.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Just think about the story you applauded.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’d love a cork in my balls.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I’d love a cork in my balls.\\r\\n It doesn’t make sense for ladies to do it still.\\r\\n In the 21st century, it makes no sense. It used to. Back in the day.\\r\\n Back when we were nomads roaming the plains.\\r\\n You remember those times.\\r\\n It made sense. Back then, duties of the sexes were clearly delineated.\\r\\n Back then, the lady, she took on full reproductive responsibility\\r\\n ’cause the guy, he’d taken on full survival responsibility. Right?\\r\\n He goes out there, you know, fighting off rival tribes and gathering meat.\\r\\n But now anyone can buy a fuckin’ Subway, you know. Who cares?\\r\\n Doesn’t matter who does what anymore. But back in the day, it did matter.\\r\\n Back then if a lady got pregnant, that was a full-time job.\\r\\n ‘Cause it takes it out of you, being preggers on the savanna.\\r\\n It’s brutal, the human pregnancy. Uniquely brutal in the animal kingdom.\\r\\n For a species our size, it takes a long time.\\r\\n It leaves a woman physically incapacitated.\\r\\n We’re an upright animal, which is weird already,\\r\\n and now, she can’t bend over to pick up any rocks\\r\\n to throw at a saber-tooth.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n So she has to keep her fella sweet so he’ll hang around and protect her.\\r\\n “Hey, baby, this mammoth giving you trouble?”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Fight off the triceratops. My history’s not great.\\r\\n She’s walking around, pregnant. For nine months!\\r\\n A sitting duck for nine months! Then she gives birth to that thing.\\r\\n It’s not over yet, lady! Now she’s gotta pick it up and hold it!\\r\\n For, like, two years.\\r\\n That’s her arms gone now.\\r\\n She can’t even uppercut the pterodactyls anymore.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n She’s gotta hold this fuckin’ useless baby all the time!\\r\\n ‘Cause they’re useless, human babies. Fucking useless…\\r\\n Fucking useless, human babies. Sorry.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Absolutely useless, human babies.\\r\\n A moment away from death at all times. Can’t survive on their own at all.\\r\\n The second they’re born, with their big, bowling ball heads\\r\\n balanced precariously on their toothpick necks.\\r\\n Every time you pick one up, they’re like, “Try not to kill me!”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’s why we came up with morality in the first place.\\r\\n You know, humans, we had to invent this thing called kindness\\r\\n so we didn’t boot our babies into the bush and move on!\\r\\n ‘Cause they’re liabilities!\\r\\n Other animals don’t need morality.\\r\\n Other animals’ babies are instant survival experts. You know?\\r\\n Like a baby elephant. You seen one? That thing just falls out of its mum.\\r\\n [splats]\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Then it just gets up and just starts walking.\\r\\n Like it’s catching up with a pub crawl, “Oh, shit, sorry, everyone. It’s fine.\\r\\n No, it’s fine. Sorry.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I thought I left my phone, but I got it.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’d love a cork in my balls.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’d love a cork in my balls. Because, ladies, I am an ally.\\r\\n [women',\n","  ' whooping]\\r\\n Just kidding. That was a test, you failed.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Never trust a man who says that.\\r\\n Yes. That was a test and you passed.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Never trust a man that says that. He’s probably lying!\\r\\n Just because a person claims to be something,\\r\\n does not mean they are that particular something.\\r\\n And you can take that from me.\\r\\n Miss Nigeria 2015.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Hard to be an ally now. Everyone’s got to be a very good person.\\r\\n It’s hard. I’ve realized I’m not a good person.\\r\\n I’m not a good person. I’m not a bad person,\\r\\n but I’m not selfless enough to be a good person. You know?\\r\\n Over the course of this pandemic, we’ve seen what it takes to be good.\\r\\n You gotta give shit up to look after others. I won’t do that.\\r\\n I’m not a good person. I’m not a bad person, before you worry.\\r\\n I’m not a bad person. I’m in between.\\r\\n Like, for example, I once accidentally sat on a cat.\\r\\n All right?\\r\\n It was an accident!\\r\\n But I didn’t get up straight away. You know, that’s…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’s where I am on the spectrum.\\r\\n I knew it was wrong, but I took my time.\\r\\n But I’m decent, you know. I’m a decent guy.\\r\\n I wouldn’t go out of my way to hurt anyone,\\r\\n but I wouldn’t go out of my way to help them either.\\r\\n I just wouldn’t go out of my way.\\r\\n That’s my moral code. If you’re falling over, I’ll catch you,\\r\\n but you need to be falling onto me, pretty much.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Got a bad back. Can’t be running around catching fools.\\r\\n It’s okay to be decent. Especially if you’re a guy.\\r\\n We’ve made it pretty easy for ourselves.\\r\\n We’ve spent centuries, us guys, lowering the moral bar for ourselves\\r\\n so all that’s required for us to be one of the good ones is to not be bad.\\r\\n It’s harder for women. Women are held to a higher ethical standard.\\r\\n I think the word “decent” illustrates this clearly.\\r\\n If you’re a decent guy, that’s a compliment.\\r\\n Notice that? “You gotta meet my friend Paul. He’s a decent guy.”\\r\\n “Shit! Let’s get a drink with Paul now!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Every second without Paul is a living nightmare!\\r\\n Where are you, Paul?!”\\r\\n There just seems to be more weight to the word “decent” if it’s a man.\\r\\n Like, if you went to a man’s funeral,\\r\\n you know, and the priest said,\\r\\n “Alan was a decent man.”\\r\\n You’d be like, “[gasps] Oh, no!\\r\\n Alan sounded like a great guy!\\r\\n Aw, I should’ve hung out more with Alan!\\r\\n Now I’ve missed out on all that sweet Alan time.\\r\\n Rest in peace, you hero. See you up there.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n If you went to a woman’s funeral, and the priest said,\\r\\n “Susie was a decent woman.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You’d be like: “Ugh.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Susie wasn’t trying, was she?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Sounds like your heart wasn’t in it, Suze!\\r\\n What did you die of? A lack of effort? Christ!\\r\\n Put her in the ground. Let’s have some sandwiches.”\\r\\n It’s difficult to be a good person all the time.\\r\\n It’s difficult to feel like a good person. All the time at the moment.\\r\\n I don’t feel like a good person at the moment.\\r\\n Especially in the wake of this COVID pandemic, I feel…\\r\\n It sounds silly.\\r\\n …a little responsible for it all.\\r\\n Because if we’re out to believe the leading theory,\\r\\n this pandemic, this virus, started in a meat market in China.\\r\\n So if you’re being lazy and a bit racist about the whole thing,\\r\\n you could blame the pandemic on two groups of people,\\r\\n Chinese people and meat eaters.\\r\\n Now, I don’t know about you, but I am both of those things.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’m a Chinese meat eater.\\r\\n All right. One of those things I can’t change.\\r\\n Obviously. No matter how hard I try, I can’t do anything about.\\r\\n And the other would require some sort of\\r\\n facial reconstruction to look less Chinese.\\r\\n [laughing and applauding]\\r\\n It sounds expensive and painful.\\r\\n Yeah. Gotta hand it to the vegans, though.\\r\\n They were right the whole time, the vegans.\\r\\n You shouldn’t cram animals unnaturally close to one another.\\r\\n It’ll all end in tears.\\r\\n And they’ve been proved right in the most dramatic way imaginable.\\r\\n And to their credit,\\r\\n they have seen this opportunity for a huge worldwide I-told-you-so,\\r\\n and they let it pass.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n With uncharacteristic grace.\\r\\n But I think that’s ’cause deep down, they’re smug about the whole thing.\\r\\n They’re being quietly smug because they know this is their world now.\\r\\n This is the world of the vegan now. The COVID era is the age of the vegan.\\r\\n Because who better equipped to thrive in the coronavirus age\\r\\n than someone for whom a loss of taste would be a blessed relief.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [whooping and applauding]\\r\\n “Pass me the mushroom burger, baby! I’ve tested positive!\\r\\n We’re having seconds tonight.”\\r\\n I’m not a vegan myself. I’ve given it a good go.\\r\\n I gave veganism a go',\n","  'od go\\r\\n over the course of a meal.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’ve decided, that instead, to offset my carbon footprint,\\r\\n I will just die 20 years early.\\r\\n There’s an old Buddhist proverb that goes, “A short life well-lived\\r\\n is better than a long one with quinoa.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n And I think there’s a lot of wisdom in those old texts.\\r\\n I’ve been trying to eat healthier.\\r\\n I’ve been trying to get slimmer, fitter, healthier.\\r\\n Working out and all that.\\r\\n I’ve let go of the, uh, comforting, but rather spurious idea\\r\\n that a person’s physical appearance is of no importance at all.\\r\\n It’s not everything,\\r\\n but it’s not nothing either.\\r\\n There’s a happy medium somewhere in between.\\r\\n But I used to comfort myself with all these old platitudes, you know.\\r\\n Doesn’t matter how I look on the outside, it’s who I am on the inside that counts.\\r\\n It turned out who I was on the inside was having trouble breathing.\\r\\n So…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Even the most well-meaning ideologies have their practical limits.\\r\\n So I started working out, put some work in,\\r\\n started working out, exercising. I lost some weight.\\r\\n Lost a good bit of weight. I lost some weight.\\r\\n [silence]\\r\\n Thank you!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Appreciate it. Really kind. Made it all worth it. Thanks.\\r\\n Lost some weight recently, lost a good bit.\\r\\n Mainly from my, uh, dick, which is a shame.\\r\\n [groans]\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Never know where it’s gonna come off, do you?\\r\\n You always hope it’s your belly or jawline. For me, it’s my penis.\\r\\n This is my body now.\\r\\n This is my physique.\\r\\n I’m content. I’m content with this body.\\r\\n I’m not happy.\\r\\n Don’t worry, I’ve not lost my mind. I’m not happy with my body.\\r\\n But I’m content, you know.\\r\\n We’re under too much pressure to be happy with our bodies.\\r\\n It’s not really the job of your body to make you happy.\\r\\n Because what is your body? Your body is just a compromise you’ve made\\r\\n between the lifestyles you want to live at the same time.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You know?\\r\\n What is your body? Your body is the intersection\\r\\n between your ideal…\\r\\n and your effort. Right?\\r\\n This is my body. This is not the body I want.\\r\\n I want a better body.\\r\\n But this is how much I want that body.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [applauding]\\r\\n It’s not like I’ve had no say in the matter.\\r\\n Just trying to look good. Started working out. Gone to the gym.\\r\\n [woman whoops]\\r\\n Started working out. Thank you!\\r\\n I started doing, uh, Pilates.\\r\\n [women whooping]\\r\\n Yeah, that’s right.\\r\\n Old Philates Wang over here.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I love the Philates.\\r\\n Gotta get on the ol’ Pilates, everyone. Pilates for the back, you see.\\r\\n If you don’t know what Pilates is, uh, Pilates is basically atheist yoga.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’s all it seems to be. Pilates.\\r\\n I’ve been doing it a while now. It’s just atheist yoga.\\r\\n It’s yoga without all the fuckin’, you know, ghosts!\\r\\n There’s none of that.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n None of that in Pilates.\\r\\n [applauding]\\r\\n Pilates is more like,\\r\\n “Bend over the stick. There is no God!” That’s Pilates.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I think it’s German.\\r\\n Started, uh, doing Pilates. Trying to look better.\\r\\n Trying to look better in my thirties. 31.\\r\\n Trying to catch the pieces as they fall off, put them back in place.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’ve started getting better haircuts. This is better, believe it or not!\\r\\n I used to be a real cheapskate with the haircuts.\\r\\n I used to go down to the nearest Lebanese guy, give him 10 pounds\\r\\n and he’d throw a pair of scissors at my head.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’d hope for the best.\\r\\n I live in the Lebanese part of London. I don’t hunt down Lebanese people.\\r\\n Now I go a bit further afield to an East Asian barber.\\r\\n Now, East Asian hair is quite a unique beast.\\r\\n It needs the appropriate lived experience. You know?\\r\\n So I go to an East Asian barber now. I go to a Japanese place.\\r\\n Because I forgive them.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You know, Nanking was a while ago. PlayStation’s pretty good. Fair enough.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I like my barber. Cool guy.\\r\\n My barber Tucker. Cool guy, Tucker.\\r\\n Cool Japanese barber.\\r\\n I like Tucker. We have good conversations while I’m in the chair.\\r\\n He’s, uh, got very good English, Tucker. He’s been in the UK a few years now.\\r\\n But he still has a strong Japanese accent. And understandably, from time to time,\\r\\n he will not know the English word that he’s reaching for.\\r\\n But for some reason, he does know the English word,\\r\\n “whatchamacallit.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I don’t know how, where he learned this word.\\r\\n But I’m so glad he did.\\r\\n Because it imbues all our conversations with magic.\\r\\n So I’ll be sat in his chair. He’ll be cutting my hair.\\r\\n He’ll just be telling me about his weekend.\\r\\n He’ll just go like,\\r\\n [in Japanese accent] “I was, uh, watching TV\\r\\n in my apartment\\r\\n sitting on',\n","  ' my sofa…\\r\\n and I saw an advert for the…\\r\\n [groans]\\r\\n Whatchamacallit…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Whatchamacallit…”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [in normal voice] There’s no point to this story. I just think it’s funny\\r\\n when he says, “whatchamacallit.”\\r\\n It’s a good word to know if you don’t know other words.\\r\\n It catches a lot of them. Classic Japanese efficiency there.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I feel like some of you got uncomfortable when I did a Japanese accent.\\r\\n Which is, of course, insane.\\r\\n But I understand. These are racially fractious times, aren’t they?\\r\\n Hard to know what is right and wrong.\\r\\n What is acceptable and what is not. What you can laugh at and what you can’t.\\r\\n And far be it for me to expect you to take an unnecessary risk for my benefit.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n So you are forgiven. However,\\r\\n for future reference,\\r\\n and to protect you from future cowardice, I…\\r\\n For future reference, I’ve come up with some rules.\\r\\n Some rules of thumb to help you decide in the moment\\r\\n whether or not it is morally acceptable to do another person’s accent.\\r\\n Would you like to hear the rules?\\r\\n [all] Yeah!\\r\\n Of course you would, you fuckin’ bigots!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n So the first rule is, the umbrella rule, the catchall rule is,\\r\\n if it’s a good accent…\\r\\n [laughing]\\r\\n play ball.\\r\\n That’s fair. If it’s a good accent, if you put in the time,\\r\\n research and practice\\r\\n to really nail that sucker down,\\r\\n I don’t think anyone has any right to complain.\\r\\n What can they even say?\\r\\n “Hey, come on, that’s bang on.” What can they say?\\r\\n Fuck it.\\r\\n [applauding]\\r\\n If it’s a good accent, have at it.\\r\\n Now, that doesn’t cover me in every situation.\\r\\n So the second rule is,\\r\\n if the accent in question belongs to a people\\r\\n who at any time had an empire…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n or were on the naughty side during the war…\\r\\n they’re not allowed to complain either!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now, this gets you more accents than you think.\\r\\n You get the obvious ones,\\r\\n like English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, German, blah, blah, blah.\\r\\n But you get fun ones too!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You get Japanese.\\r\\n You get, uh, Italian.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You get Turkish. You get Russian.\\r\\n You get Egyptian.\\r\\n You get Chinese! Yeah!\\r\\n Might not be expecting old Wang to give you this green light, but…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’m hoist with my own petard, yeah.\\r\\n China is on a perpetual imperial mission, taking over the world.\\r\\n You’re allowed to do a Chinese accent. We’re strong enough. Uh, we can take it.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I don’t give a shit when someone does a Chinese accent. Water off a Wang’s back.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n The eagle does not concern himself with the impressions of the worm.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Couldn’t care less when people do Chinese accents.\\r\\n Don’t care. My friends seem to care. My white woke friends care very much\\r\\n when someone does an offensive Chinese accent.\\r\\n They’ll tell me about people doing offensive Chinese accents.\\r\\n I’ve never asked them to.\\r\\n But apparently I have this network of terrified spies…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …who just rush off into the world, get offended on my account and rush back to report.\\r\\n “[whimpering] Did you see? That celebrity did a Chinese accent!\\r\\n Piers Morgan did a Chinese accent.\\r\\n Gigi Hadid on Instagram, she did the eyes. I won’t do them now, but she did the eyes.\\r\\n Aren’t you sad? Aren’t you offended? Do you feel diminished? You’ll be okay.”\\r\\n [mumbles, then groans]\\r\\n We’re going to kill all of you.\\r\\n [laughing and applauding]\\r\\n We don’t want to remember who did it, who didn’t do it…\\r\\n Whatever. Enjoy! Whatever, who cares. Enjoy.\\r\\n We’re busy, actually.\\r\\n Don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we’re busy.\\r\\n Handle your own HR, we’re busy!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n We’re flying to the moon. Raking over your footprints. We’re busy.\\r\\n Taking thousands of photos of your city centers for reconnaissance.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n We’re busy.\\r\\n “Oh, just a tourist, just a tourist.”\\r\\n [laughing and applauding]\\r\\n [in Mandarin] Ready, fire!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [in English] We’re going to eat you all.\\r\\n And you won’t even be the weirdest shit we ate that day.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Guys, thank you so much for coming out.

Thank you so much. You guys look great. Cleveland, Ohio.\\r\\n [crowd cheering]\\r\\n That’s why I’m here: good people, the best people. So great. Good to see you. Thank you for coming out. Look at you.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Look at you. You made a little plan for yourself. And you stuck with it. You didn’t cancel. I know you wanted to cancel. I know it. I know it. I almost did too.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Texting each other, “We still gonna go to the thing?” “Yeah. Don’t you want to go?” “No, I do. I’m just seeing if there’s any weakness on your part.” I will tear this night down.\\r\\n [laughs] [applause]\\r\\n Be home with my pants off all night. That’s all you want. You just want to be home with your pants off. Oh, it’s the best feeling in the world. And you only get it if you cancel. Oh, there’s no better feeling in the world than canceling. Oh! It’s the best! Just going from “I have to do something” to “I’m not doing anything.” Oh, what a dream. Canceling dinner plans with another couple? Oh, heaven. “You think we can cancel on ’em?” “Yes. “I don’t have to listen to him talk or watch her chew. Yes.” Oh, canceling the gym? Oh, that one’s sweet. You don’t even have to call anyone. Just do it in your head. “I’m not going.” Done.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Oh, it’s the best. Snow days? Remember snow days? Oh! It’s the best. God canceling everything on everybody. More powerful than your parents. “I want to go to school, but I can’t. God won’t let us.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Yeah, it’s a hard thing, not to cancel, and you didn’t cancel, and you made it, and it means a lot, and I thank you.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Sincerely. What else you gonna do, really? What are you gonna do, stay home? Watch the news? Watch more news? You gonna watch more news? That’s a treat. Now, are you scared? Are you guys scared? Everybody’s scared now. Are you scared? Yeah? ‘Cause you watch too much news. Turn it off. Go to a show. Look, some things are scary. I’ll give it to you. Uh, no grown-ups left, that’s kind of scary. There’s no one left to fight the bad guys. There’s adult coloring books now. Adult coloring books. And they’re popular. I saw a man–a man– a grown man– on the floor of an airport. A man laying on his stomach on the floor of an airport, just coloring, just– Why even wear pants? Why? You’re not a man. You’re a baby man. My friend’s like, “No, Tom, you don’t understand. “They are adult. I have one. It’s a ‘Game of Thrones’ coloring book.” My apologies. I thought it was something childish, like “The Hobbit.” I didn’t know it was “Game of Thrones.” That must be hard, with all the snow in that show. Having to use the white crayon? You never really know if it’s working or not. No one can deal. How about these people with the fake service dogs? You see these creeps? Fake service– there’s real service dogs that help real people. Then a girl shows up with a Pekinese sticking out of a Hello Kitty handbag and acts like it’s working. And how little do you have to think of yourself to scam a certificate and show it at the gate? “I have to have this puppy with me on this flight, or I’m gonna lose my marbles.” “Oh, by all means. Welcome aboard.” What could possibly go wrong with your crazy ass… at 40,000 feet? I got on a flight the end of last year. There was a woman next to me. I’m not making any of this up. Middle seat. She turned to me, and she had a Chihuahua in a BabyBjorn. I swear to–head, penis, legs, and dog arms. The look of humiliation in this animal’s face… He was just like, “I apologize. “We normally walk. “We’ve been walking up till now. “I’m gonna have to get pants. “This is upsett– I can’t reach.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [sighs] Look, it’s easy to scare human beings. We scare easy. We’re a timid creature, you know? We–my wife is one of those people that gets frightened in restaurants if you don’t give her exact directions to the bathroom. You have these people in your life? “Where is it? Where?” “It’s back there, to the right.” “But where? Has anyone gone? Has anyone gone?” “No, just follow a wall. You’ll get there.” Seriously, has anyone not come back? Has anyone not come back? “I miss Grandpa.” “Me too.” “We shouldn’t have taken him to the Applebee’s and let him go by himself.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Look, you get scared, but keep your eye on the ball. You know, you have to have perspective. Are you afraid of ISIS? You think ISIS is coming to your house? Are they coming to your house? No. Keep your eye on the ball. There’s so many other ways you could die.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n You drove here tonight. You made it here. You still got to get back. These roads are crazy. You should be scared of moms in Honda Odysseys. That’s who you should be scared of, not some guy dressed up like a ninja from Party City running around Yemen. Keep it in perspective. Look, life is stressful. It’s hard being a human being. It’s hard. It’s ',\n","  'hard getting through life. I understand. I had a hard day today as well. My whole day today was spent trying not to eat nachos. That was my whole day. No, they’re bad for me, I shouldn’t eat them, and I can’t stop. And I ate them again. I ate them again. Gas station nachos today.\\r\\n [crowd groans]\\r\\n Oh, back off. Your fancy Cleveland farm-to-table nacho attitude.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n You think a drug addict cares where he gets his drugs? No. He just gets them, and he puts them in his body. Look, I’m not an animal. I didn’t wake up and say, “I’m eating nachos today.” I woke up. I said, “No, today’s the day. No nachos. We’re not doing it.” But that’s a different guy making those decisions. That’s Morning Tom who says those things. Oh, no, you’d like Morning Tom. He’s a winner. He’s a winner. Oh, Morning Tom, he puts on workout clothes, returns emails, makes fruit smoothies. Fruit smoothies. Gets a blender, puts in protein powder. Neeeeeeeee! Stare down my weak family eating Fruit Loops. Neeeeeeee! “You guys are losers. You know that, right? “All three of you. You’re looking at a winner right here.” We all are in the morning. There’s a different you coming out right now. In the morning, you’re clear-eyed and focused. That’s why you never hit on anyone in the morning. You got to wait till late at night, when they’re confused and tired. They got to lay down somewhere; might as well be with you.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n No one has ever gotten laid in the history of mankind at the breakfast buffet. “I’ll be back for waffles.” But that’s okay. That’s all right, you know? Problem is, morning time doesn’t last very long. Passes out around 2:00. And the guy that wakes up in his place is a very different guy. He is not a winner. That guys is not–he’s an alcoholic, is what he is. Takes that same blender and fills it up with margarita mix and tequila.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now my kids are looking at me. “Who’s the loser now?” Drunk at 3:00. And he’s a liar. He’ll say anything to get me to drink, anything. “Come on. Just have one. “Have one. You deserve it. You deserve it.” That’s all I got to hear. “Yeah, you’re right. I do deserve it. “Yeah, I worked hard this week. I fixed the toilet too. “You don’t hear that running anymore, no. “I did that. “I took the lid off the back. “I put my hand in that creepy water. “I touched the chain with the grass on it. “I did that. “And it’s fixed. “It’s gonna stay fixed… “as long as you use the other bathroom. “Just use the other toilet. I’m not sure what the hell I did.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n And then he–please. Then he just comes at you. “Come on. Come on. “If you have one, you gonna stop at one? “You can’t stop at one. You think Sinatra ever stopped at one?” “Yeah, you’re right. “I’m just like Sinatra too, “without the songs and the money. All right.” And then three hours later, I’m just wandering around my house drunk, with a phone in my hand. “I wonder if Panda Express makes nachos.” But that’s okay. You have to have perspective in your life. You have to enjoy yourself. You can’t work crazy all the time. What difference does it make? You got to enjoy yourself. You know, if you worked all the time, what would be different? Nothing. Nothing. At this point in your life, don’t you realize how much you’re going to affect the world? Don’t you realize…\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n What you’re going to accomplish? Calm down.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Really. And that’s all right. Don’t compare yourself to the people who change the world. They’re freaks, genetic freaks. Steve Jobs, Edison– freaks. First of all, no sleep. No sleep. Three hours of sleep a night, those guys. Three. I’m out. I’m out. I need a lot of sleep. Sometimes I wake up in the morning, my first thought is, “I don’t think I can get a nap today.” I don’t even know if I’m tired. I don’t even know if I slept last night. I haven’t even opened my eyes. I know I peed five times. I don’t know if I REM’d out at the end. And it’s not a lazy thing; it’s a genetic condition. I come from a long line of nappers. The Papa family naps. My whole childhood was waking up adults to ask them stuff. They would just lay around the living room like a pile of sea lions.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n “Dad, Dad. “Dad. Can I go to Keith’s house?” [long moan] “Grandma, Grandma, can I go to Keith’s house?” [long moan] “She moved her whiskers. That’s yes. Let’s go.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n And so what? So you don’t work all the time. What’s gonna happen? How’s your life gonna change? What, you’re not gonna be part of the super-rich? Is that what’s gonna happen? [muttering] First of all, that shouldn’t be a goal. It doesn’t change your life at all. And second of all, the list of people with all the money shrinks every year. It’s down to ten people now. In two years, it’s gonna be, like, Bob. Bob has all the money. Everybody, just sleep in. Take the whole summer off. Bob’s got all the money. And it shouldn’t be a goal. It’s just this abstract thing that you just keep chasing, you ',\n","  'know? I’ve–personally, never a goal. I don’t need a lot of money. I can live a poet’s life. I really, sincerely could. Don’t need money. Don’t need stuff. Always giving it away. I could move every week. I really could. But, uh, I do not live alone. [chuckles] I’m married, and I have two children, and they are greedy, capitalist pigs.\\r\\n [laughter and applause]\\r\\n “More, more, more.” “Whaaa.” “I want food with every meal.” “Whaaa.” So I work hard. All my money goes to them. Every damn penny goes to these people. I live in a horrible school district in L.A. now, and it was either pay for school or guns and ammo. And they have no skills or coordination, so I’m paying for school. Goes against everything I believe in, but I’m paying for school. My only rule for paying for school is, I won’t pay for any school that is predominantly Asian. Why? Why would I pay all of that money for my kids to be last in everything? We can’t compete. These families are dominant. They kick ass. We can’t compete. They’re straight-A students. These kids play five instruments, five. They’re walking to school. They have an oboe and a violin and a drum kit. The dad’s pushing a baby grand piano across the parking lot. My kids play the toilet paper roll. Literally, we just walk around the house. [imitating horn playing music] “I think you got it, honey.” [imitating horn] “I don’t think you have to practice anymore. “Get some Pop-Tarts. Sit on the couch. Enjoy your life.” They beat us everywhere we go. I put the little one on the swim team. I figure we have a chance there, right? Let’s go to the pool. That’s an Asian-free zone. Let’s try it. Not anymore. They dominated every other sport. Now they’re at the pool. But my kid’s big. She’s got a back like Michael Phelps. I’m like, “We can take ’em. Come on. We can do this.” They hit the gun. Their kids took off like speed boats. My kid, two strokes, drowned right in their wake. We scooped her out, resuscitated her, put her right back on the couch. And we quit that night. We quit that night. She was like, “I thought we’re not allowed to quit things, Dad.” “Yeah, well, I’m not gonna be humiliated “like that again. “I’m not gonna ruin my Saturdays “and sit through that. “Yeah, you lay there “and think about what you might be good at, and we’ll try again.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now–so I’m not gonna be part of the super-rich, and I have news for you. Uh, you’re not either.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n They don’t do this. They don’t come out to the ass end of Cleveland, sit in the dark, and listen to jokes.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n They do different things. They summer. They summer. They summer. Do you summer? I don’t summer. Summer happens, and I deal with it. Just stay in the shade and walk slow. No, they buy all white, a whole white wardrobe on Memorial Day to go summer. I can’t wear white. I bought a white shirt last year. I sweat through it in 20 minutes. It looked like I was smuggling turkey gravy under my armpits. Yeah, I should have thrown it out, but I spent 20 bucks for it at Old Navy. I’m gonna wear it. I just kept my arms in the reason of the season. No, we don’t summer. We don’t wear all white. My family doesn’t have parties in the middle of a wheat field. We don’t have a dining room table in the middle of a field where food just falls from the heavens and everyone’s beautiful and the dad stands up and quotes Shakespeare and everybody laughs, ’cause they get it. That is not my family. We go to my sister’s picnic table. We eat egg salad sandwiches. We push Grandma in the kiddie pool, and her tit pops out. That’s what we laugh at. That’s what we get. “Oh, Grandma, your titteth has poppethed out. To be or not to be in a home.” I say we keep her. She’s hilarious. Puts sponges in the toaster. Who does that?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Look, there’s nothing wrong with making money, right? You want to make money. You have to make money. I’m not saying you want to be poor. We’ve all been there, right? When I started comedy out of college, I made five bucks a night, five, in New York. I needed the money. It was fun times, but everything smelled like hot dogs, everything. I did. My girlfriend did. It was like, “Are we making hot dogs again?” “No, that’s us. We got to get jobs. This is not working out. We smell weird.” But how much is enough? You know what I mean? How much is enough? Do you really need a mansion? Who needs a mansion? Who needs a mansion? If you have 80 children, you should have a mansion, right? If you have 80 children, you need that square footage. You know what these places look like, ’cause they come in the beautiful real estate section of the Sunday paper, this beautiful magazine filled with mansions. Why? Why are you putting that in the poor people newspaper? Who’s couponing and looking for a mansion in the same paper?\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n They always have those perfect kitchens, the beautiful island with a fruit bowl with a pyramid of perfect green apples. You eat one. A new one just appears out of nowhere, ’cause ',\n","  'they have an apple boy. They have an apple boy. Just sits under the kitchen sink and waits. I’ve never even bought a fruit bowl. Have you ever bought a fruit bowl? No. You buy fruit. You need a bowl. You just pick it out of the other bowls. Congratulations, bowl. You’ve been nominated. Say good-bye to your friends. You’re the fruit bowl. And fruit isn’t even the main thing in the fruit bowl. It’s mostly car keys and pennies and garlic skin. One black banana from 1995. No one wants to pick it up, ’cause you know it’s gonna split. So if you have a lot of money and you help people, that’s one thing, but the culture’s devolved into this “I’m better than you” attitude just to have stuff. You know people in your family and friends who just mortgage it, lease it just to say, “I’m better than you,” even if they don’t have it. “Just look at what I have. “Look at my car. It’s newer than yours. “Look at my wife. She’s newer than yours. “She might be older, but she has all new parts. “Where do you shop? The regular supermarket? “That’s disgusting. “I can tell from your skin, “’cause it’s splotchy and gross. “No, I respect it. I just can’t do it. “I only shop at Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s. “That’s where I get my conflict-free M&Ms. Naaah. Naaah.” I’m done with the Whole Foods. I’m done with it. I like eating healthy. I do. But you have to be a billionaire to eat healthy? I’m not spending five bucks on an apple ’cause you thought it was a good idea to ship it from Vermont by bicycle. “Then where you gonna get your kale? How you gonna get your kale?” I don’t know. I don’t care. I don’t even know what it is. My grandmother never made it. My mother never saw it. It just showed up, like, a week and a half ago. But it’s here now, and you got to eat it. Well, how do I know what it is? ‘Cause it takes like mulch, and you feel like a koala bear when you’re chewing on it. “Are you supposed to eat the stem? Oh, okay.” Hard to tell the eat part from the throw-out part. They get up to the register. They put on a whole show about their bags. “I have my own bags. “I want everyone here to know “I wouldn’t use their bags. “I am an angel sent from heaven. “I wove my own bags out of human hair and seaweed.” Get over yourself. These people have driven me to Costco. That’s the only place I shop now. I go to Costco. Yeah.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Yeah. No one acts like they’re better than you at Costco. Everyone knows exactly who they are at Costco. “I’m disgusting, and I need more stuff immediately. “And I’m making one trip. I brought the big car. This is my only weekend out.” There’s a sense of community when you go to Costco, right? You can’t go there by yourself. You can drive there alone. You’re gonna have to make some friends on your way in. You can’t get a 25-pound salami on your back by yourself. Trying to throw it in your cart like the Scottish strongman competition. The place is so massive, they got to hand out little samples in cups to keep up your strength. It’s like a white trash marathon in that place. “Here’s a fried baloney ball. You’re doing great.”\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n “There’s fried chicken popsicles, aisle ten. You’ll get there by Tuesday if you keep up the pace.” [chuckles] You get to the register. No one’s talking about bags at Costco. They don’t even have bags. They have boxes with holes in it. “There was a dead pig in this yesterday. “I don’t know if that bothers you. “The cardboard’s a little wet. He was a bleeder.” And they know they’re not gonna live forever at Costco. They have coffins at the door. They literally sell coffins at the door, which sounds absurd until you look in your cart filled with Cheez-Its and Slim Jims. You’re like, “How much longer can I live like this? “Seriously? “You know what? Today’s the day. “I’m buying a coffin today. “You know what? Give me the coffin. “I’m gonna use it as my box. Put all my stuff in there.” Wheel it–\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Look, I don’t even blame you if you’re one of the Costco people or the Whole Foods people. It’s not even up to you anymore, right? You go to a store once, they take so much information from you, you end up in this long-term relationship with these companies. Back off. I deal with human beings. That’s enough. I’m not dating you, CVS. Every time I go to CVS, “Do you have your card? “Do you have your CVS card? Do you have your card?” “No, for the tenth time this week. No, I don’t have a card.” “You don’t have a card? “This man doesn’t have a card! “This man doesn’t have a card. You’ve got to join us.” People coming out of the back, “Join us. Join us.” “No, I don’t want to join you. “I don’t want anything on my keychain. “I didn’t want to make eye contact with you, frankly. “I just want to sneak in here, get this ointment, go home, and deal with this.”\\r\\n [laughter] [applause]\\r\\n “Do you take money? “I’ll pay you money. “I’ll pay you double if you let me leave. “I should be home with my pants off, solving this problem right now.” When you don’t join up, they act like a psych',\n","  'otic girlfriend on your way out. “Well, how about your email or your phone number? “We’re not gonna use it; we just want to have it. “We just want to smell it when you’re not here, ’cause we love you.” Back off. Check into the hotel, “Welcome back, Tom.” “Whoa, what do you mean, ‘welcome back’? “You don’t know me. “That’s why I stay with you. You don’t know me. “I know people in town. I don’t stay with them. “They know me. “This is our relationship: “I come in late at night, “I do weird stuff to your towels, “and I leave in the morning. Forget my name.” Every restaurant, they can’t just come up to your table now. They got to bounce up there. “You guys ever eaten here before? You guys ever eaten in an Outback Steakhouse before?” Just lie. “Yeah, I’ve been here before.” They leave, and they get your drink. My wife likes to be honest. “No, I’ve never been in one of these before. What’s gonna happen?” He’s gonna do a show. He’s gonna do a goddamn show. “Let me tell you how it works. “We’re a little crazy at the Outback Steakhouse. “You think you’ve been eating your whole life, “chewing and swallowing? “That’s not what we do here. “You order your appetizer, bring out a cannon, and we shoot it right in your face.” They all have their own credit card now. “Do you have your KFC MasterCard?” “What?” “Do you have your KFC MasterCard?” “No, I don’t have a chicken credit card in my wallet “with a picture of a plantation owner on the side.” “Well, I could save you 15% of your purchase right now if you apply for a KFC MasterCard.” “Yeah, I’m sure the 25 people behind me “wouldn’t mind me filling out some paperwork and running a credit check during their lunch half-hour.” I don’t care about 15% of $8. I don’t care. I just want to sit in the parking lot by myself, eat it quickly before my wife comes out of Banana Republic and sees I’m not following doctor’s orders. Move it. “But if you don’t use the cards, “you’re not gonna get your points. “If you don’t get points, you won’t have status. Don’t you want status?” Don’t fall for it. Don’t fall for it. There’s no such thing as status. It’s all illusion. They try and fool you. Doesn’t matter how many points you have, where you fly on the plane, what you drive. We’re all exactly the same: horrible animals running around in pants, trying to keep ourselves busy, fighting the overwhelming urge to mount each other and make smaller versions of ourselves.\\r\\n [laughter and applause]\\r\\n All the same. But they try and fool ya, right? Flying here, “Okay, we’re gonna board your flight now. “Not everybody. Sit down. “Not all at once, you maniacs. “There’s some special people here “getting on that plane first, ’cause they have status. “We’re gonna start off with our diamond-crusted, “gold-plated, carbon fiber-based, Teflon-coated, “premier, elite-access, super-duper Douchebag Flying Guy Club.” And the whole place stands up. Everybody has it. How special is it? There’s one guy in the other lane with a crooked leg and a cane. “I have no status at all.” And he walks funny, so they board him first anyway. I travel a lot. I travel all the time. I was traveling a lot last year, and I took my family out with me. Figured that would be a good thing. That was– what do you call that? A mistake. That’s a mistake. That is not a good thing. You realize when you travel with your family, you don’t really know these people all that well. When you’re home, you’re like bees in and out of a hive. You don’t really hang out. And then you wake up that first morning in a hotel room just looking at each other. [chuckles] “You guys are pretty weird, right? “Does the little one always do that? “I didn’t even know we had her. She doesn’t look like any of us.” Big moment this year, though, during the travels. The kids, for the first time in their lives, wheeled their own luggage. Huge, huge milestone. ‘Cause look– yeah, it’s big. It’s a big deal.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Look, I’ve made my own people, right? I’ve made my own people. I’ve made two people, and I am their leader. I am their leader. So when they want to go somewhere, I have to plan it, because they don’t know where anything is. They think New York and L.A. are right next to each other. I have to pay for everything, ’cause they have no money or skills of any kind. But for years, I would have to carry everything that they owned, like a mule, like a human mule. They would literally load everything on my back and then sit on top of the pile like a small Peruvian lady, and I would just walk through the airport with canteens hitting my legs, just standing at the gate with flies in my eyes. And sometimes you see a donkey with flies in his eyes and you think, “Why doesn’t he get those flies out of his eyes?” Now I know. I’ve seen a donkey’s soul. He doesn’t care about the flies. He hopes the fly eats through his eye and devours the part of his brain that feels and remembers. Oh, but this year, the handle went up, and they just walked ahead. I was crying in the airport, I was so hap',\n","  'py. Still can’t pack, though. We got to the hotel. The only thing there was a Curious George and some magnets. Really? Two week’s vacation. You thought that was gonna do it. All right. Hope you like that bathing suit. You’re gonna wear it a lot. And I’m still learning about my wife, still learning about my wife. Oh, I married a talker. I married a talker. 16 years together. Still coming up with new stuff to say every goddamn day. She starts from the minute she gets up till about a half-hour after she falls asleep. Just talks… She’ll talk to anybody. The housekeeper at the hotel doesn’t speak any English at all. My wife doesn’t care. “Then my mother said she didn’t like my hair. Can you believe that?” This poor woman’s like, “Oh, no. Terrible.” Then we come home. She starts talking to the cats. Cats, they don’t speak any language at all. My wife just sees two ears, like, “I should fill those with talking noises. “How many times have I told you not to go on the counter? We talk about this every day.” Cat’s like, “Meow, meow. That’s terrible. Meow.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Went to Disney for the first time, a trip to Disney. That was, uh– that was rough. That was rough. That is not a good place. They call it “the happiest place on Earth.” For who? For who? Ugh! Look, I love the idea. I love the idea that this man created something out of his own head. He just wanted to create a nice little place where families can go and kids can let their imagination run wild and feel safe for a couple hours in this horrible world. Beautiful idea. But what he couldn’t foresee when he was developing it in 1950 was the type of people it was going to attract in 2016 in the United States of America, ’cause they didn’t make these kind of people back then. There weren’t dinosaur-sized people stomping through the park with their elephant children attached to their tail… Pushing the biggest strollers I’ve ever seen. I had no idea John Deere made strollers. One woman had five kids in it. Fi–I never–I don’t know what you even call that. A pentalometer? A jumbotron? Five pumpkin-faced kids eating cheeseburgers, and she’s plowing through the crowd, knocking other families out of the way like tumbleweeds just so she can get to the churro stand first. Then there are people there, women, who have no children at all, who want to be a princess themselves. Grown women who want to be a princess. They want to dress like Cinderella, but they don’t make a Cinderella dress for someone 48 years old, 6’5″, 380. They never had a meeting and said, “Let’s make more of those.” Does that stop them? No, it does not. They buy that dress. They stuff everything they have into it, and a lot doesn’t fit. There’s a lot of extra hanging over the sides. But that’s okay. They’re happy there. They have their autograph book and their wand, and they skip through the park. Fine. Honestly, I didn’t think I was gonna fall for it. I didn’t. I didn’t think we were gonna do. I didn’t. But once you make your own people, the ads just find you. Every time you open your phone, open your laptop, turn on TV, there they are, just selling you joy and perfection, right? Every time you turn it on, the mom and dad are beautiful, perfect teeth and hair, clothes. “I love you.” “No, I love you.” “You’re beautiful.” “No, you’re beautiful.” “Our kids are beautiful.” And the kids are holding Mickey’s hand, looking back at the parents. “Thanks, Mom and Dad, for not being stupid and poor.” I’ll admit it; I wanted to be that family. I wanted to be that family. We were not that family. We didn’t come close. We were not perfect. We were sweaty and pissed off and cursing in front of the children. “This is your damn fault. “If your parents didn’t raise you like an animal, we would have left a little bit earlier.” And the kids don’t even hear us, ’cause they’re slapping each other in the face. And we haven’t even parked yet. We haven’t even parked. We’re still in the van. We’re pissed off ’cause we didn’t get to park in Mickey and Minnie parking. They sent us with that big hand to the ass end of Chip and Dale parking. That’s another tram ride we didn’t plan for. Then you get to the front of the park. I know it’s a cliché, but you get up there. You open your wallet. They take everything you got. Everything– every dollar, every coin, every credit card, gym memberships, pictures of your family, unused condoms. That mouse rapes you at the turnstile, and you have to plaster a smile on your face in front of your kids, ’cause you don’t want to ruin the happiest place on Earth. “It’s gonna be a great… day, guys. It’s really gonna be a lot of fun.” Then you get inside. It’s just line after line after line. I thought I was gonna beat it. I had the app on my phone. I’m like, “I’m gonna beat ’em.” No, you’re not beating Disney. I’m like, “Let’s go on the Peter Pan ride. “That’s a horrible ride from 1912. “Look, no one wants to even go on it. The line only goes back and forth two times.” Yeah, up here. Then they take you to the',\n","  ' basement. It loops around for three days. Then they shoot you out the ass end. It goes around the Matterhorn 12 times. And it’s a bad ride. It’s a bad ride. Old cardboard cutouts, Christmas lights that don’t even work anymore. All the voices are jumbled. [distorted] “I’m Tinker Bell. I’m Tinker Bell.” 2 1/2 hours! Was it worth it? No. What would be worth it? Nothing. I get to the end of that line, there could be naked supermodels with bags of money and all-you-can-eat nachos. I’d be like, “No, not into it. You lied to me.” [chuckles] Here’s what I learned, though. Here’s what I learned. If you go ahead and go–and if you make your own people, you’re gonna have to go– you just want to go once. You want to go once, so you got to blow it out, make it all about the kids, go big. Give ’em your money. “Here’s $300 cash, kids. “Spend it the way you want to spend it. It’s your day.” And halfway up Main Street, they’ll be broke, ’cause they’re small, and they’re stupid and gullible. And they’re going to buy a lot of blinking stuff that’s not gonna work by the time they get outside. And now they’re laying in the gutter of Main Street like little Disney hobos, broken toys, crying, just yelling at the characters. “Get over here, duck, and shake your ass. I got nothing left.” Make sure you fill them with sugar, a lot of sugar. Make them tweak out on sugar. Don’t even have to wear sunblock. “How about that, kids? “You hate when I put it on you. “I don’t want to put it on you. “Don’t wear it. I bet you don’t even burn in Disney.” They do burn, especially when they’re little. They turn purple, and they start to blister. And now they’re crying. They got broken toys. They’re crashing on sugar. And this is when you walk ’em. You got to walk the hell out of ’em. Give ’em the map. “Anywhere you want to go.” “Oh, you want to go from the Cars ride “to It’s a Small World? “Sure, 20 miles apart. Let’s start walking.” Midnight rolls around. They’ve been on two rides the whole day. We’ll never go back again. My kids see that mouse now, they shake like they went to war with it.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I like moving around, especially by myself. You get to see a lot of people, and it’s inspirational. You know, people are good, and they’re kind, and they look out for each other. And–yeah, I actually like people more the older I get. When I was younger, I didn’t like people so much, and now, you know, you realize, “We’re all the same, you know?” You pee on your own leg more than three times a week. You’re like, “How great am I?” You know? And that’s another thing I don’t understand about the wealth. I mean, what’s the thing? What’s the goal? To just get so much money, you isolate yourself from everybody else? Just go from your helicopter to your island and back to your place? Why? We’re only here once. You got to mix it up, you know? Look, I’m not Pollyannaish about it. I mean, sometimes I get around people in a crowd, I wish I had my own helicopter. Not just to fly away. I would turn it upside down and chop everyone’s head off.\\r\\n [laughter and applause]\\r\\n Sometimes. But for the most part, people are cool, and they look out for each other, and it’s nice, you know? And the only bad part: it only takes one person who doesn’t know how to act among us to ruin the good time of everyone else, some disgusting behavior, and it ruins the good time of everybody, ’cause they’re breaking the human contract, which is very simple. You’re abiding by it right now. So when we get around each other, just turn it down a notch. Don’t do publicly what you like to do privately. When you’re alone, it gets kind of weird. That’s okay. You’re an animal. There’s only so long you can not put a finger in one of your openings. That’s okay. Hey, you got a job to do. They don’t make tools for everything you got to get done. Fine. Right now, there’s someone in here that likes filling up his pants with Cheez Doodles and dancing around like a pretty pony. And he’s not doing it. He’s fighting the urge until he gets home. And we respect you for that, sir. We thank you. And I guarantee you it’s a sir. I guarantee you. These other people don’t care. They think the whole world centers around them, disgusting people. They just walk around peeing on things, farting everywhere, letting their dogs go all over your lawn, blowing their nose in the air. Have you ever been around that guy? What the hell? What is– what goes on in your head where you think, “I’ve got something in my nose” and the other part of your brain says, “Blow it out of your face now”? And they’re good at it, which means they practice. Awful people, disgusting people, the same people that curse in front of children, don’t give up their seat for old people, don’t hold the door open for women– awful people. They’re the same people that bring their own smelly-ass food on planes. They apparently think they’re flying alone, and they bring this smelly-ass food that they made in a disgusting laboratory they call a kitchen. Awful. You k',\n","  'now who these people are, by the way, ’cause they’re the ones walking through the airport carrying their own pillow from their bed. That’s a psychopath. If you’re a grown-up and you take your pillow out of your bedroom, you better stop at the couch, and you better have the flu. You open the door and take it out into the world with you, you should be caught with a net, and we should never see you again. “Going on a big trip today. “What’s that? You’re so right, pillow. You’re so right.” Look, I don’t think there should be food on a plane at all. How about that, chubsy? How about that? Can you survive without a sandwich? Can you do it? During the Great Depression, we ate nothing but rusty nails and dirt for years. Can you make it to Boise without a sandwich? All right, maybe I’m insensitive. Maybe you have a tapeworm that needs feeding. I don’t know. I don’t know what’s going on inside your gut. But then be nice, something non-offensive. How about an apple, maybe some trail mix? The last flight I was on, a guy broke out a tuna fish and dead skunk ass sandwich. I don’t know what part of Whole Foods has that, but this guy found it, chopped it up with tuna and mayo, and put it on rye. And he waited till the doors were shut and we’re at 10,000 feet. He released this stink bomb like it was a planned attack. You ever smell something so bad that you just get confused? Your head snaps back. You make little circles with your hands. You just blurt something out. “Roosevelt!” [panting] “Just keep breathing out. Just breathe out, out.” “It’s too late. I breathed in. It’s in me. I breathed in. I messed up. It’s in me. I can taste it. I can taste it.” People were opening their air vents just to get air from somewhere else. “Oh! Oh! I don’t care if it’s from the engine. Oh!” People were putting their faces in strangers’ armpits for relief. You know what kills me about these situations? All the good people, the social tension of all the nice, cool people. How many other people on the flight? 200? 300 people? So nice, so kind. They don’t even complain. They just sit there and suffer in silence. You’ve never been in that situation and have a guy pop up at the back. “Are you kidding me? “No, honey, let me go. This has to be said. “7:00 in the morning, skunk ass. “Screw you! Oh, I’m the bad guy. All right, all right.”\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Never. The most you get, people just roll their eyes and whisper. “Pee-yew, he smells. I think it’s skunk ass. I would never do that. That’s terrible.” I’ve got two people that I made. I’ve got two kids. And they’re going through a weird phase. I don’t know if it’s a weird phase. It’s just–my kids are finally realizing I’m not as great as they thought. You know what I mean? Like, for years, I was their god. They were amazed by everything I did. “He gets food. I don’t know how he does it.” “That’s nothing; I saw him lift a chair over his head by himself.” “Wow!” “I know!” The other day, I was yelling at ’em. I mixed up their names. They shot me a look like, “Oh. Maybe our leader’s an idiot. Maybe he’s not kidding when he says he can’t help with our math homework.” And they’re not wrong. I can’t help them anymore. I don’t understand it. But I have to act like it’s a parenting decision for my own ego. They’ll be like, “Dad, can you help me with my math homework?” “No, I’m not giving you the answers. This is between you and your teacher. Work it out.” Then I’m in the bathroom on YouTube, “How do you add fractions with different bottoms? “Oh, you just got to make them the same.” “How?” “Uh…”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [sighs] My daughter got in the car the other day. She reached over my shoulder. She hit the radio. A whole Taylor Swift station came on that she reprogrammed herself. I’m like, “No, when did you do that?” And I change it. A Katy Perry station comes on. She hijacked the whole radio. I’m like, “When did you do that?” She’s like, “Don’t worry about it. Just make it louder.” Could you imagine? I couldn’t imagine, as a child, getting in my father’s car, demanding my music, and then, “Louder. Lower. A little louder. Right there, Chief. Right there.” When I eventually came out of my coma, they would have told me a story of how arrogant I was and why I lost five years of my life when I was hit in the head with a pipe. And as the only man in my house, it’s my job to maintain my importance in the family by teaching my daughters that there are no great guys. That’s my job: to teach my daughters there are no great guys.\\r\\n [scattered applause]\\r\\n Yeah, I believe it. Yeah, there’s a lot of guys applauding that. You know. There’s no great guys. If you think you’re with a great guy tonight, you’re not. Look, American men are as great as you’re gonna get. We fight for equality, and we push strollers. We wear diaper bags. We tell you we want equal pay. But keep in mind it’s an act. It’s an act. Because inside all of us is a 16h-century man who wants to burn the village to the ground. He’s always in there, so just keep ',\n","  'that in mind. If you have a man, you have a wild animal. This is a wild animal, so use him wisely. You’re in control, so don’t do stupid things with your man. Don’t ask us to do certain things. Don’t be stupid. Don’t ask us to watch the children. What are you doing? We’re not really watching the children, not the way you watch the children. We watch them eat bottle caps and fall down stairs. And we laugh. Don’t ask me to shop with my 13-year-old. I shouldn’t be shopping for clothes. I shouldn’t be in Forever 21, waiting for my daughter to come out of the dressing room. No one there knows I have a daughter in the dressing room. They just see a sweaty, uncomfortable man breathing heavy by himself next to the bras and panties. And I shouldn’t pick the young one up from gymnastics. No dad should be picking up his daughter from gymnastics. I shouldn’t be hanging out with the other moms, waiting for it to be over. They’re all talking about juice boxes and play dates. All I’m thinking is, “Which one of these moms would I have sex with first?” I’m being honest. That’s where our head goes. Not which one would I have sex with, by the way, ’cause I’d have sex with all of them. The weird one, the one with the thing on her eye, I’ll make it work. I can make it work. But which one first, while I’ve got the energy? That’s my job, try and give them lessons, but it’s hard, because the real world starts coming in, right? And they start learning about the real world. I try to protect them, but they start learning about all the good and the bad that’s out in the world, and it’s funny in my house, ’cause they’re learning about it at different rates. You know, like, we learned about Thanksgiving, and the little one’s like, “Oh, we love Thanksgiving. “We love the Indians. We gave them our buckle hats and our shoes and a turkey, and they gave us some feathers and some mashed potatoes, and we had dinner with them, and they love us, and we love them.” And the 13-year-old’s just leaning against the refrigerator. “What’s this Trail of Tears I’m hearing about? We took their land and then moved them out west, then took their land again and then killed them all?” And the little one’s like, “It’s not the same Indians, right, Dad?” I’m like, “Yeah, it’s the same Indians.” She’s like, “Why did we do that?” “Oh, easy with the ‘we,’ first of all. We’re the Papas. We’re Italian. We got here in 1945. We eat spaghettis and ride Vespas. We’re lovers.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But it’s hopeful to see this generation, ’cause they just–they just– you know, they’re more tolerant, and it’s not even tolerant; they don’t have to tolerate it. They don’t even know that things are bad or that they hate each other. They’re just nice and nice people, and it’s very hopeful. They don’t even see race. They don’t say “black people” or “white people.” They just say “darker” or “much darker” or “whiter” or “much whiter” or “gross.” That’s how they talk. The first time my daughter ever heard about race, she saw “The Jackie Robinson Story,” and that really blew her away. She’s like, “Wait a minute. “Are you telling me that white people had to let the black people play baseball?” I was like, “Yeah, that’s how it happened for a while.” She’s like, “No, no, no way. “Isn’t it the black people who let the white people play sports?”\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n She’s like–she’s like, “‘Cause I’ve seen some of our white people play basketball. We shouldn’t do that.” And I’m like, “Yeah, they let us play once in a while. “They also let us make music, and that’s where country comes from.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n The only reason I want a son is because that’s the only thing ruining our good time on the planet. The only time someone loses it and does something awful, 100% of the time, it’s a guy. And I don’t get it, ’cause I was a man… for a while. I was, before I built this vagina tribe that I live in. You really can’t be a man in the vagina tribe. You can’t. I watch the play-offs, but people are putting bows in my hair and doing my nails at the same time. No, angry young men, I really don’t get it. Just calm down, guys. Calm down. You feel like a loser? That’s okay. We all do. We all do. You’re not missing out on anything. We’re all losers. We’re human beings. You get little moments of victories, and most of the time, you lose. That’s okay. That’s the way the whole world works. Travel all around. Everyone’s exactly the same. Thank God you’re not that happy, or I wouldn’t have a job. You’d just sit at home and call your friends. “Ha-ha ha ha ha. Life is wonderful.” No, you have to pay for your laughter, and I am your prostitute.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n It’s okay. I’m happy to do it. But come on. You’re a young man. Get your life in order. Just get anything. Get a guitar. Get a skateboard. Get a girl. Get a girl. You’re 19. Get an 18-year-old girl. That’s the only age that won’t sound creepy. 19, everything is working full bore. That’s not gonna last. You think everyone’s with supermodels? No. Lower the bar. Lower th',\n","  'e bar. Any woman will soothe your soul. Go to a bowling alley. Go to a bowling alley. Go to the back of the bowling alley. There’s a deep fryer in the back of the bowling alley. There’s a girl working that deep fryer. That’s your girl. She’ll be a ton of fun. You’ll get fries and onion rings on the side. Get a cougar. That didn’t exist when I was 19. There weren’t hot, middle-aged women looking for young men to violate. They’re out there now in force. Go to any ladies’ night in any Holiday Inn in Any City, USA. Walk out on the dance floor. Push all the 50-year-old douche bags in their Tommy Bahama out of the way. Raise your arms. “I’m 19.” They will rape you on the dance floor. And look, there are angry young women out there. There’s a lot of angry young women. But they don’t blow stuff up. They just terrorize one guy at a time. They pick one guy out, and they just ruin his life. It’s not nice, but it’s better for the community as a whole. [laughs] But we’re gonna be just fine. And look, look. You have to vote for the right people that are gonna do the right things, and if they don’t do the right things, then you just get them out. That’s just the way it goes. Don’t stress about it. Move it along. That’s the way it goes, ’cause it’s their job. They got to deal with that stuff. We can’t do it. We’re busy. We’re busy, all right? I can’t go out and fight ISIS. My house is crazy. I got enough to deal with in my house, right? You got all your stuff to do. You got to watch LeBron run around. You’ve got to go to games. We’re busy. We’re busy people. I can’t fight ISIS. Neither can you. One of my cats just died. That’s what I’m dealing with. Yeah. Well, we had three, so two to go. No, I love cats. I love that level of intimacy. I wish my kids were more like cats. That would be perfect. Oh, my God. And please, if I could just leave food for them once a week and they brush against my leg to let me know they’re alive, perfect. Perfect. I don’t even know why we have these animals. Do you? It makes no sense. All these years of engineering and walls and electricity to keep nature out. Then we just open the door like a bouncer. “You two, come on in. No, not you, squirrel, you coke addict. Get out of here.” Then you have an animal just sitting on your counter, looking at you. I was watching TV the other day. My cat, looking at me, dropped its ass, back legs up, front paws, just started pulling itself straight at me, six feet across. Didn’t break eye contact the entire time. Stared me down. “That’s right. My ass in your carpet. What of it? What you gonna do about it, go in my box? I don’t think so. Who’s scooping it out? Not me. Never have, never will.”\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n It’s a crazy house. 16 years putting this whole thing together, and it works. I wish you the same success. I really do. And the family is a good thing. 16 years in the family, 16 years with the same woman, the same person. Good thing. [cheers and applause] It’s good, and it works. But it’s time for a girlfriend. It’s definitely time for a girlfriend. It’s not fair. It’s not fair to my wife. It’s not fair to this woman to expect her to act like a girlfriend for this long; it’s not. Look, when you’re a girlfriend, you’re motivated. You’re excited to see that guy come home. My wife is not that good of an actress. This poor woman has watched me walk from the bedroom to the bathroom in the middle of the night, underwear hanging off my ass, banging into furniture in the dark, for 16 years. How could I expect her to be like, “Oh, goody, I hope he hurries back”?\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n I’m out of stories. I’ve run out of stories. You ever hang out with a married couple, the guy starts telling a story, the wife just starts stirring her drink and rolling her eyes? “Here we go again. Blah, blah, blah. We’ve all heard it, Don. We’ve all heard it.” We’re entering that stage. I’m a comedian. She doesn’t think I’m funny. It’s time for a girlfriend. And look, I’m not gonna be sneaky about it. I’m not gonna cheat. I’m gonna sit her down. I’m gonna tell her my plans straight out. I’ll be like, “Look, I found a girl. “She’s young, and she’s dumb. She’s just what we need. She hasn’t heard any of my stories. She thinks I’m hilarious. She wants to fool around all the time. Don’t think of her as my girlfriend. Think of her as your assistant.”\\r\\n Thank you so much, Cleveland. You guys were wonderful.

Here we go, Houston, Texas! [cheering] Let’s get this show on the road. Dwayne Johnson here, also known as The Rock, also known as La Roca in Spanish, also known as the sexiest motherfucker alive. It’s not important right now, but what is important that you guys have come together to see one man. The man who hails from a place that many of you know. The Alief area.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n Yes. [chuckles] “The SWAT” as we call it. Many amazing people have come out of the Swat. Lizzo, Beyoncé, Travis Scott. [cheering] And one other person, who you guys did not know has come out of the Swat, is the one and only people’s champ, The Rock! [cheering] Well, just for tonight, I’ve come out of the Swat. But tomorrow I’ll be from some place else. Probably Hawaii. Listen, what is important right now, [chuckles] is that I have the honor of introducing the man who you have come to see. Ladies and gentlemen of Houston, a warm hometown Houston welcome for the man himself. [whistling] The other people’s champion. My boy. Your boy. Mo Amer.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n [deep base music drops]\\r\\n [cool slowbeats music playing]\\r\\n [cheering and whistling]\\r\\n What’s up, Houston? All right, all right, all right, all right. Take a seat. Take a seat. Take a seat. We made it! We made it. [music fades out] We made it, y’all. For real, like, it’s so amazing. We’re all here together. I mean, after the last 19 months that we’ve had. I mean, we’re here. We’re together. As a live performer I thought it was over, to be honest. [laughing] And now we’re here. That was the second time I ever thought my career potentially might be over. The first time… [laughing] was right after 9/11.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n Someone named Mohammed. I was like, “It’s not looking good for me out here.” [laughing] [Mo chuckles] Matter of fact, my own family turned on me. [laughing] My own brother looked me dead in my eyes and goes, “Your career is over.” [laughing] I was like, “How could you say some shit like that to me?” “You know I always wanted to be a stand up comedian.” He goes, “Look how they’re talking about us on the news.” “Nobody wants to see a Mohammed on stage telling jokes.” “Your career is over.” I said, “Omar, you’re a pilot.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n Now I’m in a movie with The Rock. In your face, bitch. You know what I mean? [chuckles]\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Wow. Is it over though? [sighs] Is the pandemic over? [sighs] Was it real? [sighs] But what, is it over? No for real, I’m asking. Is it though? [soft grunt] I’m always like laughing and about to cry at any moment inside. I’m like [chuckles and grunts]. Was is real? Is it? You know what’s real? Divorce is real. Divorce… [laughing] Divorce is real as fuck. Divorce is so real. I got divorced in the pandemic. It happened, you know. What are you gonna do? [whistling] We both one guy’s happy.\\r\\n [soft cheering and applause]\\r\\n It’s not like those stories that you hear where a comedian’s like, “Fuck that bitch.” No. It just didn’t work out. You know what I mean? And it’s fine. And when you’re married for so long you’re just use to certain things. I was dead asleep one night. And then I farted so hard. [laughing] I farted so hard I woke up ashamed. Like… [gasps] Like this. [laughing] And I looked over to my left and I apologized. And there was nobody there! [laughs] [laughing] I just turned over and cried. I was like… [sobs] [laughing] I wrote that shit down immediately. I’m like, “This is hilarious.” [sobs] [sobs then laughs] [laughing] Is it real? Was it? Is it real? I don’t know. Fuck. [laughing] It’s how I feel… [grunts] …all the time.\\r\\n Pandemi you know, what the media did to us was, honestly, it feels unforgivable. It really did. It’s like, “Panic!” [screams] “It’s coming!” “What’s coming?” “I don’t know. It’s co',\n","  'ming.” [laughing] [shouts] “Three people have it.” “What? Huh?” “It’s coming!” “What’s coming?” “Something that has to do with a bat.” “I don’t know.” “Bats are coming?” “No!” “It came from a bat.” [laughing] “And it’s this thing you can’t see with your naked eye, but it’s coming.” “You’re all gonna die.” [screams] “But don’t be scared.” “Don’t” “What do you mean?” “Huh?” “I’m scared.” “I’m worried.” [chuckles] “Don’t worry, just get Chlorox.” “You’re gonna be fine.” [laughing] “Get as much Chlorox.”\\r\\n [soft applause]\\r\\n “But don’t use the Chlorox… [laughing] …before you use Chlorox on the Chlorox.” “Then you could use the Chlorox, okay.” [laughing] “When you get packages, fucking bathe with the packages.” [laughing] They had us all a bunch of assholes. We’re like… [spraying noise] [laughing] “Amazon came in.” [spraying noise] [laughing] “It’s fine, fan it out. It’s fine.”\\r\\n [soft cheers and applause]\\r\\n [screams] [laughing] “Put on a mask.” “How many masks?” It kept changing. [laughing] “Put on a mask. One mask.”, Fauci said. “One mask is like 33% protection.” “Two masks are like 66% protection.” [laughing] “Three masks are like 97% protection.” And then a plastic bag, just 100%. [laughing] Just kill yourself. Just… [grunts] asphyxiate. “Oh, no, we lost another one to COVID!” [laughing] “Nah, bro, one more bag, bro. He killed himself.” [laughing] [huffs] “Stay home. We figured it out.” “Stay home.” “How long?” “I don’t know.” [laughs] “Monthses, I think.” [laughing] “How many monthses?” “Just monthses, bro, I don’t know.” [laughing] “It’s gonna be monthses.” “How many monthses?” “We don’t know.” [laughing] “You’re supposed to know.” “I know.” “But we don’t know.” “It’s monthses. Just stay home.” “Well, I have to go to work.” “Fuck your job,” they said. [laughing] “Fuck your job.” “What do you mean, fuck my job?” “I don’t have to pay rent?” “Whoa, hold on, take it easy.” [laughing] “Capitalism. Take it easy.” “You still have to pay your rent.” “Oh, so, hold on, but then I have to go to well, then, send me money. You know what just send me money.” “No, whoa, what are you, a crackhead, bro?” [laughing] “We can’t send you money if if” “What are you talking about? We can’t send you” “Why you stuttering a lot, bro?” “Just send me this money.” “We we don’t have any money, okay.” [soft laughing] “We don’t have any” “What are you talking about?” “We send you money, but that’s how this works, okay.” “We send you money and you allocate it for different buckets. Right. You got Social security, you got Medicare, Medicaid, there’s a lot of buckets.” “And I’m sure you have a rainy day fund.” “Bro, you gotta have a rainy day fund.” “And it’s pouring outside.” “Fucking full blown hurricane season.” [laughing] “Seven hurricanes hitting at the same time.” “Send me some fucking money.” “I have a confession, we’re broke. Okay.” [laughing] “What do you mean you’re broke? You’re the federal government.” [laughs] “I know, I know.” I know, we’re in debt, okay.” [chuckles] “We’re in debt, all right, it’s” [laughing] “It’s a lot of it’s debt, okay.” “How much debt?” “We’re just minus okay. We’re just…” [laughing] “We’re just” “I know what debt means, bro, just how much minus?” “It’s a lot of minuses.” [laughing] “So much minus. A lot of minus.” “Just spit it out. How much is it?” “Twenty trillion dollars.” [laughing] “Twenty trillion dollars?” “Who’s balancing this cheque book?” [laughing] “MC Hammer? Who’s managing this whole situation?” “How did you get 20 trillion dollars minus?” “Killing Brown people is so expensive.” [audience cries out in surprise] “Oh!” “It’s so expensive.” [loud sigh] “Just so much. So as you can see, we can’t send you money.” “If we’re in minus. Overdraft fees are piling up. We can’t… [laughing] send you out of minus.” [laughs] “What, Kyle?” “The stock market is gonna fail?” “Holy shit, Kyle. Heat up the printer.” “Heat up the fucking printer.” [laughi',\n","  'ng] “Make three trillion dollars appear.” “And let’s funnel it into the Ponzi scheme that is the stock market.” [soft laughing] Because the stock market is a direct reflection of American hearts everywhere. If the arrow’s going down that means hearts and souls of Americans everywhere is also going down. “But look it’s working, it’s going up!” “Americans are happy again.” “It’s going up.” [laughing] “It’s sky rocketing!” “Wait, wait, wait. How the fuck is it sky rocketing?” “We’re all at home. I thought…” [laughing] I…\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n “How is it…”\\r\\n [soft laughing and applause]\\r\\n “How…” “How is this thing going up?” “I thought it was all based off of revenue streams and quarterly earnings. And nobody’s working.” “I get Amazon. Shit.” [laughs] “Everybody is at home ordering, this should be sky rocketing.” “Well, fuck you, Jeff Bezos, and thank you, Jeff Bezos, all at the same time. “Like, but how is this still going up, bro?” “I thought this was all based off of money coming in. Everybody’s at home.” “Look man, shut the fuck up, okay!” [laughing] “Just look at the arrow. God, can’t you just shut shut your mouth and just be happy that the arrow’s going up?” “No, I can’t, bro. We need money.” “Look here’s $1,200. Hush money.” “Shut the fuck up.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n “Thank you. That’ll last me a week. I appreciate that.” [laughs] “Stop trying to distract me.” “How the fuck is this arrow going up, though, for real?” “Homelessness is at an alltime high.” “Look, aliens are real. Chew on that for a little bit.” “What?” [laughing] “You talk to them?” “Yeah, bro, all the time, it’s crazy.” “Just look at the arrow, all right.” “No, still, like, so many unemployed.” “Fifty million people unemployed. How the fuck is the arrow going up, bro?” “Look, Jada cheated on Will Smith. Chew on that for a little bit.” [laughing] “What?” “Why, Jada, why?” [laughing] “What happened?” “Something about entanglements, I don’t know, it’s crazy.” “Just look at the arrow.” “Just look at the fucking arrow.” “No, for real, stop trying to distract me, bro. How is this arrow still going up, okay? Please explain yourself.” “Look, I’ve got a hot tip for you, okay.” “Cryptocurrency.” [laughing] “What the fuck is cryptocurrency?” “It’s these little people inside of a computer.” “And they’re just mining. They’re just mining for these digital coins, okay.” “What you do is, you move the real fake money over to the… [laughing] over to the more real fake money.” [laughing] “And what you do is, you just move, once you have more real fake money, you move your real fake money over here” “and you just keep doing that.” “I’m so confused.” “Hey, man, I’ve got another hot tip for you. NFT’s.” “What the fuck is a NFT?” [shouts and laughing]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n “It’s a blockchain of ownership…” “You know what, I’m just gonna put a plastic bag over my head. Fuck this shit.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n [cheering] Is it real? COVID’s real. I had it. Dave Chappelle gave me COVID. That’s right. [laughing] Well, that was the second time. [laughing] But the first time, he hits me up right at the beginning of the pandemic. He’s like, “Say, Mo, what are you doing?” I’m like, “I don’t know if you’ve been watching the news, bro.” “I’m at home, dog, that’s what I’m doing.” [laughing] “That’s what you do. We’re all at home. I don’t know if you were watching.” He was like, “Yeah, you can’t let them break us.” I’m like, “We’re broken, bro.” “The whole country is broken.” He was like, “That’s why I’m hitting you up.” “I’m gonna do these shows out in this cornfield in Ohio.” I was like, “I don’t know, man, this doesn’t sound very, I’m not sure, you know.” He was like, “No, no.” “We’re gonna test everybody every three days.” “It’s gonna be very safe. We’re gonna do the best we can. Nothing is guaranteed, of course.” “We’re gonna do the best that we can, every” I was like, “You have testing machines, bro? Th',\n","  'is is the beginning of the pandemic.” [laughing] “Like, how did you get testing machines?” He just went nuts, He was like, “Say, nigga, I’m Dave Chappelle. Of course I got these”\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n I was like, “Good point.” Really good point. So we go, I go to Ohio. And it was a amazing run of shows, like, almost four months of doing these shows. And we almost made it, but we had outbreaks and we had to stop it. And he made it into a documentary film. It’s an incredible documentary film. I saw it at Radio City Music Hall. It was the first time that I got to see it. And then I watched it and I was like, “Wait, the end of the movie makes it look like I ruined the whole fucking party.” [laughing] I got COVID and the whole thing had to shut down because I was being a bitch. I was like, “Wait, hold on a second.” I walked up to Dave. I’m like, “Dave, the way you edited this, you made it look that Mohammed was the villain in the whole situation.” [laughing] “That’s not the truth, bro. I didn’t do” He’s like, “Ah, man, nobody’s gonna think this.” And right after he walks away Bradley Cooper walks up. He’s like, “Man, this is really fucked up how you just ruined the… [laughing] ruined the party in Ohio.” I was like, “It wasn’t me.” “An awardwinning film maker is saying that this is what it looks like.” “Oh, no!” And it wasn’t my fault. It was this tiny little lady. She was really small. And she was handsy. Really handsy. [laughing] And she was touching me all the time. “Hi, Mo.” [giggles] “Hi.” [laughing] Just doing this all the time. I’m like, “Hey, stop touching me right now.” “First of all, it’s a pandemic. Like, I don’t you that well enough” “and stop touching me, like” And then she fakecoughed in my face. [fake coughs] Like this. And I was like, “I love dark humor, but that’s [laughing] That’s not funny!” “It’s not funny, bitch. It’s not funny.” And then she tested positive three days later. [audience sympathizes] I was like, “I knew she was Israeli. I knew it.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n I knew it. I knew it. They were having a meeting in Hollywood. They were like, “This Palestinian’s getting too powerful.” [laughing] “Just send him this unassuming little gremlin to try and kill him with COVID.” I survived, bitch! I survived! [laughing] That was the first time I got COVID. [laughing] The second time, Dave Chappelle calls me again. [laughing] Saying, “Man, what you doing?” I’m like, “I’m recovering from COVID.” [laughing] He’s like, “I’m gonna do these shows in Austin. Joe Rogan is gonna be on it.” “It’s gonna be dope.” “You should join.” I’m like, “Dave, I don’t know if this really worked out for me the first time.” [laughing] And he was like, “Nah, man, this is gonna be different.” “We gonna test every day.” “Last time we were only testing every three days. We’re gonna test every day.” “So we gonna catch that ho and put her in a closet.” [laughing] “You’d be straight.” I was like, “Fuck it, let’s do it.” [huffs] [laughing] We’re like ten days into doing shows and Dave walks up to me and he’s like, “Hey, man, I got this joint from JayZ.” I was like, “Word?” He was like, “Yeah, I got this joint from JayZ.” I was like, “JayZ’s here?” He was like, “Nah, man, JayZ has a weed company and he sent me these joints.” [laughing] “You wanna go? Let’s go roll around your car and let’s smoke this together.” I’m like, “Shit, Dave Chappelle has a joint from JayZ asking Mo Amer if he wants to smoke this shit, you’re damn right, I’m gonna smoke the shit out of this joint.”\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Obvious. So then we’re cruising and then he lights up the joint. And I should’ve known better! Because he took a hit and then he goes… [coughs] like this. [laughing] I was like, “You okay, Dave?” He was like, “Yeah, yeah, I’m fine.” “I’m fine. This JayZ weed makes you do JayZ impressions like…” [coughs] “Djeah!”\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n I took the joint. I took',\n","  ' a couple of hits. I was like, [coughs] “… djeahhova!” [chuckles] [laughing] Smoke it. We laughed. It was a great ride. And then I dropped Dave off because it was like 30 minutes until show time. And then I started texting him, I was like, “Say, bro, you want me to swoop you up?” “Is there special guests, should I come later?” And he went silent. And I was like, “This is weird.” “Dave, we just dropped you off, bro. This is really odd.” And then friends started texting me. They haven’t heard from him in, like, weeks. They were like, “Hey, man, is Dave okay?” I’m like, “Yeah, Dave’s okay.” “You don’t know him, that’s my boy.” [laughing] “What are you talking about?” “We just hanging out.” And then they sent me a link. I was like, “What is this link?” So I touched the link and it opens up. And it’s TMZ front page news, “Dave Chappelle tests positive for COVID.” [sympathy from audience] Then I was like, “This can’t be true!” And then I was like, “Shit, It’s TMZ, they’re always right, these motherfuckers.” [laughing] I was like, “How did they know before I knew?” “I just dropped off Dave.” “He called them before he called me.” “Fuck. That’s fucked up, bro.” And then he tried to deny it. I walked up to him and I was like, “Dave, it’s fucked up you gave me COVID a second time.” And he goes, “There’s no way to really prove that, Mo.” [laughing] [laughs] I was like, “Bro, the first day you tested positive I was smoking a joint with you.” “Minutes before you tested positive.” And he got silent and he just goes, “I’m sorry I gave you COVID, bro.” [laughing] [huffs] And then he goes, “Walk it off, at least it’s not AIDS.” And he’s just walking around like this.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n [Mo laughs] Is it over? [chuckles] Is it? [grunts and laughs] [laughing] [laughs] So I am done. I had that shit twice. Okay. Fauci, “Only seven people in the world have ever gotten it twi” Bullshit! I’m special, but I’m not that fucking special, Fauci. [laughing] So I’m done. I had it twice. And I’m vaccinated. I’m over it. I’m over it. I got the Pfizer vaccine. [cheering] That’s what I want. Everybody has their favorites, but I went with Pfizer. I want… [laughing] I want like a German scientist making my shit, you know what I’m saying? [laughing] I want the guy like, [in fake German accent] “Yavi, hows the Pfizer? Ya!” “We knew he was coming out of Wuhan.” “The COVID. And we are way ahead of schedule.” “Ya! We have the vaccine! The Pfizer!” That’s the one I want. That’s what I\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n The what?\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n “Yaza!” [chuckles] “Hmm, ya, iz good, ya, we have the Pfizer.” [chuckles] [laughing] “You have the Pfizer? I have the Pfizer.” [laughing] [chuckles] I’m not doing Johnson & Johnson. I’m not doing that. [huffs] I don’t even use their regular products. [laughing] And they make too many for my comfort, bro. [laughing] You want me to tell you like, “What’s in the Johnson & Johnson?” “I don’t know, man, like we just started off with a little snake venom in there.” [laughing] “And then we just added some Johnson & Johnson baby powder to thicken it up a bit.” [laughing] “Some Johnson & Johnson baby oil to loosen her up a bit.” “Then we put a goddamn baby in there.” [laughing] “Just a whole fucking baby.” “And we finished it off with a little wild turkey to give it that pop!” “Know what I mean?”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n “How many shots do I take?” “No shots, we just pass it mouth to mouth.” “You just come on now…” [laughs]\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n It’s so absurd. I [huffs] It’s so absurd, like [huffs] Like, vaccines having accents is so ab [chuckles] What’s Moder [huffs] What’s Moderna? [imitating Mexican accent] [laughing] “You got that derna, bro?” “We give you one shot then you Crip Walk out this bitch.” You know what I mean. Like, bra, lets do it?” [laughing] Like I’m g [chuckles] That derna. [chuckles] [grunts and exhales sharply] [laug',\n","  'hing] Fuck! [laughing] That’s how I feel inside. [soft laughing] I do. That’s how I feel inside. All the time. Fuck. [laughing] All the time. I’m just… [grunts] fuck. [laughing] [grunts] Fuck. And fuck is just not a potent enough word, to be honest with you. It’s not strong. Once you speak another language, you realize, you realize that the English language is just like a newborn, you know. [laughing] It is. It’s a new language. Like, I speak Arabic. Arabic is an ancient language. [sighs] English is like it’s baby. It wants to grow up and be Arabic one day and it’s just… [laughing] It is, it’s just…\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n No, it’s fine. It’s just a baby. It’s just a baby. It’s not a It lacks a lot of depth. It’s just not, it’s just not very strong, like “fuck”, it’s nothing. It’s an exclamation point, you know. Even greetings in Arabic takes so long, you know. [soft laughing] Greetings are like, “Peace be upon you.” “And may peace be upon you.” “And the mercy of the divine be upon you.” “And may the mercy of the divine be upon you.” “And may divine light be with you.” “May it be unto you as well.” “May it protect you and your entire linea” “Hey, man, can I get this pack of cigarettes, bro, and get out of here?”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n It’s a lot. It’s a lot. In English, it’s, “Hi.” [laughs] That’s it. It’s over. [laughing] [chuckles] It’s over. [chuckles] “What’s up? The sky?” [mock giggles] That’s it, there’s nothing else. [laughs] It’s nothing. [laughs] So when somebody curses you in English, sincerely, you could probably walk away 99.9% of the time if you didn’t get emotionally charged. Really. It’s an oldie but a goodie. “Hey, fuck you!” “I don’t wanna fuck you.” [laughing] And you could, just walk away. [soft laughing] “Hey, go fuck yourself!” “You know what, man? I’ve been really tense lately.” [laughing] “And maybe what I need to do is go fuck myself.” [laughing] “Hey, you’re a motherfucker.” “Not my mom, but…” [laughing] “My exwife did have child from a previous marriage, so I guess I am a motherfucker.” [soft laughing] “And by the way, your father, biggest motherfucker of them all, technically.” [laughing and a whoop] “Hey, you’re an asshole!” “You know what, the eye cannot see itself.”\\r\\n [laughing]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n “And I cannot see when I’m being an asshole, so thank you for making me a better person.” And just walk away. “Hey! You’re a pussy!” “Yeah, I’ll take that.” I don’t know why “pussy” always insinuates weakness. Pussy is metaphorically and physically very strong. [loud cheering] So strong!\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n It’s true. Absolutely true. It’s so strong. It can have a baby. Human life. [whoop] Pounds of human flesh can come out of this little, tiny hole. Pop! And it can have two at the same time. Pop! Pop! [laughing] It can have three. Pop, pop, pop. [laughing] And then it regenerates… like this. [laughing] Almost. Exactly how it was. Almost. [laughing] Almost. Exactly how it was. Maybe if you laugh or cough, you piss on yourself, but otherwise… [laughing] Otherwise, it’s there. Ready for you once again. [laughs] [laughing] [laughing] My friend, Chris, passed a kidney stone out of his dick hole. [laughing] He damn near died, okay. [laughing] He was like, “Oh, God, what’s happening to me?” He was like, “Somebody shoot me!” And it was a grain of sand that came out of his dick hole. Women, “Pop! Pop!” Come back. [laughing] Little grain of sand… [groans] [laughing] You be a dick. I’ll be a pussy any day of the week.\\r\\n [loud cheering and applause]\\r\\n [cheering and whistling]\\r\\n Arabic curse words. [soft laughing] They’re really graphic. [laughing] They’re so graphic I don’t even use them. Honestly, I just… We’re gonna start here and build up. [laughing] Like “Kes Emak”, which means… [murmurs] …”Fuck your mother’s pussy!” [laughing] Very specific. [laughing] [Mo huffs] We take that to another level. “Kes Emak Eli Nafadek” whic',\n","  'h means… [laughing] Which me two people, “Yeah, I know what that means.” [laughing] [chuckles] Everybody else is on their toes, “What does it mean?” [laughing] It mea “Kes Emak Eli Nafadek” which means, “Fuck the pussy you slithered out of!” Wow! [shocked laughing] [Mo laughs] Astaghfirullah I know, it’s crazy. [laughing] [indistinct] Everyone saw the baby fall out. It’s a visual curse word, that one. [laughing] This is one of my personal favorites, “Yela3n Tarekhek”, Which means, which means, “Damn your entire history.” [laughing] “My greatgrandmother?” “No, bitch, from the beginning of time…” [laughing] “…to present day and everything in between and in the future, fuck your DNA.” [laughing] Astaghfirullah, I don’t need this. It’s a lot. Even Western hand gestures. Not that big of a deal. “Uh, fuck you bro, uh.” [laughing] In England it’s a reverse peace sign. Very confusing. [in fake English accent] “Oh, fuck off, oh.” [laughing] And they try to be like, “No, it’s from the war, yeah.” I’m like, “Shut the fuck up, okay. [laughing] “It’s not that cool.” Arabs, we go to another level. We go sideways, we go “BeTizik”, like this. [laughing] BeTizik, like that. BeTizik, like this. A little pop…\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n BeTizik, like that. [laughing] Little wiggle. BeTizik, like that. BeTizik, like… [laughs] This means “in your ass.” That’s what this means. [laughing] That’s what… [laughs] [laughing] And if there’s any confusion, you just put the other hand up like this and you go BeTizik, like this. [laughing] And you wiggle it. You wiggle it, all up in the ass, that’s right!\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n I feel like a lot of people are gonna be leaving here, like, “Hey, Kyle.” “Yeah.” BeTizik bro! [laughing] [Mo laughs] [laughing] Fuck! [soft laughing] [grunting] [soft laughing] [laughs and soft grunts] [laughing] [in Mexican accent] …bro. [soft laughing] Mexicano’s, bro. I love Mexicano’s.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Let me say, growing up in Alief, you can’t… [whoop and cheers] we can’t. You can’t… You grew up around Mexicano’s. You do. And they always sound like they’re in pain. [in fake Mexican accent] “Come on, bro, let’s hang out.” [laughing] “You all right?” “Yeah, I’m doing fine, bro.” “Are you sure?” [soft laughing] Love Mexicano’s. They’re resilient people, hard working people. And it’s fucked up they even started a conversation about putting a wall up. Shit, this never worked it human history. And you keep repeating the same bullshit. First of all, it’s Mexicans. Most creative people I know. Huh? It’s like…\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n So creative, the Palestinians were taking notes and shit. When El Chapo snuck out of that tunnel with a motorcycle, we’re like, [in Arabic accent] “Hey, Abdallah, come watch, bro.” [laughing] “Hey, he put a motorcycle inside a tunnel, bro?” “We need to do this back home.” Ya Habibi Ya Allah. [laughing] You’re not gonna stop Mexicans, bro. It’s not gonna work. Put up a wall and they’ll just zipline back into the country and shit. They’ll be like, [in Spanish] “Ready, José, I’m ready.” Push me, motherfucker. Come on, go fuck your mother.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n [in English] They’d be like, “Did he make it?” “I don’t know, bro.” [laughing] “I think he missed the trampoline.” [laughing] “Ziplining, this is so tricky.” [laughing] “Timing is everything, bro.” [laughs] [laughing] If I was Mexican living in Mexico, I’d flip the whole script. I would. I’d be like, “You know what, bro?” “We’re building a wall, okay.” [laughing] “We’re building a wall. You can’t come to Cancùn no more, puto. How about that?” [laughing and cheering] How about that? That’s it. You’d have the White girls You’d have White girls crying all across America. [laughing] They’re like, [imitating a girl] “Oh, my God.” “I just wanted to go to Cancùn for Spring Break.” “Why are they so racist? I don’t understand.” [laughing] “Now I have to go to P',\n","  'uerto Vallarta.” [laughing] That’s also in Mexico. [girl voice] “Oh, my God!” [laughing]\\r\\n [soft laughing and applause]\\r\\n Love Mexicano’s. I love doing accents. It’s a lot of fun, you know. When you can do them like, [in fake Mexican accent] “Come on, let’s hang out, it’s” It’s fun. The German’s fun. [in fake German accent] “Ya, ooh, it’s lovely here.” [laughing] I mean, I fuck with them all day. Russians though, I don’t fuck with Russians. [cheers and laughing] I don’t fuck with anybody that talk like this, [in fake Russian accent] “What you say to me?” [laughing] “You fuck me, my family? What you say to me?” [laughing] I’m like, “I’m good, bra. I don’t trust you.” [nervous laugh] [laughing] A Russian guy in an Adidas tracksuit. I’m good. [in fake Russian accent] “What you say to me? You fuck around?”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n “What you say?” “I’m good, bra.” “I’m goo…” I don’t fuck with anybody with a Russian accent and I don’t fuck with anybody with cauliflower ears. [laughing] I don’t fuck with them. And if you talk like this and you have cauliflower MMA ears, I don’t fuck with you either, bro. [laughing] That’s how I knew Khabib Nurmagomedov was gonna be the greatest MMA fighter of all time.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n All time.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n [in fake Russian accent] “He talk like this. And he has the ears.” Fuck that, I’m not fucking with you, bro. You’re a real one. And the way he talks is terrifying. [Russian accent] “Oh, you think you’re real? You think you’re from streets?” “I grow up in real mountain.” Like, “What does that mean, bro?” [laughing] “What does that mean?” “What do you mean you grew up there?” “What did you do there?” [laughs] He’ll say wild shit like, “Oh, yeah, you want to fight?” “I’m gonna change his face.” [laughing] “What is he, Potato Head, bro? You can’t do this.” [laughing] You can’t fuck with him. The guy The man wrestled bears as an eightyearold. This is, you can really look this up. He wrestled bears as an eightyearold child. The only people that would do this, is Dagestani’s. Because there’s levels to being Russian. There’s like regular Russian, there’s Chechnyan, and there’s Dagestani’s! It’s a whole another level, where they wrestle bears, apparently. And from childhood. What the fuck are you talking about? His father, God rest his soul, were the greatest coaches of all time. And how did that conversation even happen? Like he walked up to his dad like, [in fake Russian accent] “Daddy.” [laughing] “Daddy, I really want to be great champion.” “Daddy, please, please, train me, Daddy.” Like, “No, son, you’re not ready.” “No, I’m ready. Please, please.” “Train me, Daddy.” “Okay.” “I go get bear. Let’s see.” [laughing] Brought a bear into the house. What did his mom say? “Hey, honey, what you doing with bear?” “I know, I know.” “Relax, bear, relax.” [laughing] “I bring bear. Okay.” [laughs] “I bring bear. Bear gonna wrestle Khabib.” “Khabib one day will be great champion.” “Defeat racist leprechaun in the future.” [laughing] “Save Islam. Alhamdulillah. Come on.” [cheering and whistling] [huffs] Don’t fuck with Russians. Germans, I’ll fuck with them all day. [in fake German accent] “Ooh, ya, it’s wonderful.” [laughing] I did that accent at my first special and a lot of people messaged me like, “Hey, man, you sound like that fat caterpillar from A Bug’s Life.” [laughing] I was like, “No, I don’t.” And then I watched it and I was like, “Ah, shit, I do sound like that fat” It’s like, [German accent] “Ya, look at my wings. I’m a beautiful butterfly.” [laughs] [laughing] [Mo] Whatever. [grunts] [laughing] It’s such a blessing to be together. Listen, let me tell you something. I sincerely, I am mad at what they did to us. I really am. The fear that they created. And the division they created. It’s fucking infuriating. “Who you voting for? Red or blue?” What am I, Bloods or Crips? That’s what I heard. That’s all I heard. All',\n","  ' you are gangsters. Okay. Okay, all of you are gangsters. I’m with the people. Always will be with the people. That’s what it is about for me. When the hurricane came through, my neighbor, Scott, redneck Scott, this guy is the best. Okay. He’s always prepared. So I’m never prepared, because I know he’s prepared. [laughing] He’s always like, “Yeah. I got generators. Hell yeah, I got generators.” “Fuck, yeah, Mohammed, I got you, baby.” You know. [laughing] When I came through he hooked me up, bro. I plugged into the side of his house and took that extension cord all the way across that culdesac and plugged my shit in. And that’s what it’s about, bro. They’re trying to separate us, but the fact is Mohammed’s in Texas get along with redneck Scotts all day.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Fuck what you talking about. Fuck what you talking about. That’s the honest truth. People try to just push this particular agenda and it’s not, I do believe in us. I do. I believe in us and then and then I travel and then I go to an airport and I realize how fragmented we really are. We suck as the human race. We suck. [laughs] We’re all in our own bubbles. Nobody’s paying attention to anybody else. Everybody just You’ll see this in an airport. You’d be walking and all of a sudden the person in front of you just stops and just looks up. “What’s up there?” “I’ll tell you what’s behind you, bitch.” “Thousands of people.” [laughing] “Trying to get where they want to go.” “That’s what the fuck is going on.” “What the hell is wrong with you?” “Get the fuck out of the way, all right.” [soft laughing] If you’re travelling with a carryon with no wheels on it, you’re an asshole, okay. [laughing] You just have them all over your shoulder. You’re a fucking mess. [panting] It’s sliding off. “Oh, sorry.” [panting] Wheels exist. What’s the matter with you? [soft laughing] If you have a carryon with only two wheels, this is what you look like, “Hi.” [giggles] Look how much square footage you’re taking behind you. Why the fuck are you doing this? “Hi.” [giggles] [fake laughs] [laughing] What the fuck are you doing? Four wheels exist, man. This is what you look like in four wheels. Like a smart, intelligent human being. You can go forward. You can go backwards on that whore. You can juke a motherfucker and just keep going. [laughing] You have a baby, you put him on top of it and you keep it cruising. [laughing] Now if you have a four wheel carryon and you only use two wheels, you’re probably the biggest asshole of them all. [laughing] We can’t even read numbers. We get to the boarding gate and they’re like, “Boarding…” “Boarding group one.” [high pitched voice] “I’m in seven, can I go?” [giggles] “Well, what he” “I’m in eight since seven’s going.” “Get the fuck out of the way. What are you doing?” [laughing] Then you get on the plane and here comes the people with no wheels on their bags. [panting] Just clotheslining every other person. [thumping noises] [laughing] They have no clue, they just… [panting] And here comes the assholes with two wheels on their bags. Just dragging it behind them… [laughing] …and they’re getting stuck every other seat. “Sorry, sorry.” [fake laughs] “Sorry.” [fake laughs] Turn it around, whore, and see where you’re going.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n Use your eyes. Maneuver. [sighs] Drives me insane. [laughs] Flight attendants, all due respect… [whoop] Well, I would wait to finish the bit, bro. [laughs] [laughing] It’s not good. You’re not saving anyone, all right. You take your job way too seriously. [laughs] [laughing] Somebody has an issue, you just go, “Is there a doctor here? Because I don’t know what I’m doing. Please, somebody.” [laughing] If you have a little bag and it’s a bulkhead, and you have it on the floor, oh, shit. [loud breathing] “We have to put this bag over here.” They’ll shortcircuit on you. “We have to put this bag up top, okay. Just for take of',\n","  'f. And they will give it to you immediately after takeoff, okay.” “Well, then, if you gonna give it to me after takeoff, immediately after takeoff, then why the fuck have I got to move it in the first place?” “Just in case we have an emergency exit situation.” “Wait, we’re gonna exit the plane?” “At like 150 miles an hour?” “What the fuck are you talking about?” “No, no, no, we have to move the bag.” “According to the FAAAAA.” [imitates explosion] [laughing] Shut down. God damn shut down. God, the safety announcements. Oh, my God. “Put on your seatbelt, everybody.” “Because that’s what’s gonna save your life. Okay.” “Yes, a seatbelt from 35,000 feet… [laughing] …to pummel into your imminent death. Okay.” “On a floating rock in space.” “That’s what’s gonna save you, is a seatbelt.” No. They just want your ass in the seat after the plane crashes. They don’t want to have to hire a thirdparty company to look for your bitch ass. [laughing] That’s all it is. They don’t. They just want to get there after the crash, “Adams 3F. There he is, yup.” [laughs] [laughing] “Well, most of him, right.” [laughs] [laughing] It’s all they want. [huffs] Because if they really thought the seatbelt was gonna save your life, they would check every single person as if it’s a roller coaster ride, right. They’d be like, “You’re good. You’re good. You’re good.” “You goo Oh, you almost died, Ralph!” [laughing] “You almost died.” They don’t do that shit. They just walk by. “You’re good. You’re fine. Fine.” [laughing] One flight attendant started to argue with me, “No, Mo, what if we’re having a crash landing and we have real bad turbulence, you could fly up and you could break your neck!” I’m like, “That’s what I want. I want to break my neck.” “I want to be the motherfucker like this while everybody’s screaming for their lives. That’s what I want.” And while everybody’s like, “Oh, my God! Were gonna die!” I’m already dead. I’m good to go. [laughing] Just smacking motherfuckers with no wheels on their bags. [smacking noises] [laughing] That’s what I want. [soft laughing] [huffs] Yes, I remember, if we lose cabin pressure, me first, fuck the baby. [laughing] The little oxygen thing comes down. Me first, fuck the baby. Not my rule. Your rule. [laughing] Flew in from New York to Houston. Okay. I live here, but we flew in from New York to Houston and there’s not a single body of water in sight. But we have to worry about this flotation device, everybody. You put the thing on over and you buckle up the front. And then you pull the string… [swoosh noise] like that. And it will inflate. But if it doesn’t inflate, don’t panic! There’s a straw right here. [laughing] That only, apparently, requires one breath. One magical breath. They make this shit look so easy. Just… [blows] “You’re fine everybody, you’re fine.” Bitch, have you ever tried to inflate anything manually in your whole life? [laughing] I did my nephew’s pool party. I damn near died doing his floaties. [laughing] You’re telling me in the middle of a crash landing, we’ll be like… [screams and blows] [laughing] Dead. [laughing] Don’t worry, there’s a second and third layer of protection, okay. There’s a little flickering light, okay. It’s not even a light. It’s a reflective light the size of a dime, I shit you not. The size of a dime and a whistle. Okay. In the vast, echoy, reflective oceans of the Earth, this is how we’re gonna find your bitch ass… [mock whistle noise] “I’m right here.” [mock laughs] [whistle noise] “I’m right here.” [mock laugh] [whistle noise] “You haven’t found the Malaysia plane.” [laughing] “An entire jumbo jet, bitch.”\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n You’re gonna find my bitch ass, just floating around… [whistle noise] “I’m right here.” [whistle noise] “I’m right here.” You just told all the ocean’s predators your exact location. You’re dead. BeTizik is what I’m saying. [grunts]\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n [grun',\n","  'ting and laughs] [laughs] [laughing] Fuck! [laughing] For the first time, for the first time I ever felt this way in my life. I’m a refugee that came to America, I’m an American citizen, of course, now. But, you know, for the first time everybody that was making fun of Texas in California, right in the middle of the pandemic, “Oh, we need to go to Texas.” Yeah? “You need to come here?” For the first time I felt this way, “Go back to where you came from, son of a bitch.” [laughing] “You’re fucking up our real estate.”\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n “Go back home.” That’s how I feel. That’s how… I was like, “I get why they do it. It felt good, a little bit. It felt good.” [soft laughing] I am an ArabAmerican. That’s what I am. Didn’t do it. Yup.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n PalestinianArabAmer This is… [cheering and whistling] Listen. Thank you. All right, let’s start that party. Let’s do it. Here’s the thing. I’m not doing that for applause. I did that just to tell you that’s how you identify yourself. I am an ArabAmerican. That’s how it works here in America. If you’re not White, you have something before American. [laughing] Unless when I’m buying a gun. That’s the only time. When you’re buying a gun in Texas, the first question is, “Are you hispanic?” Super racist. “No.” [laughs] Next, “Are you AfricanAmeric” “No.” [laughs] And then there, has no ArabAmerican. I was like, you know what, fuck it, “I’m White as fuck today.” “Give me that double barrel, 12 gauge shot gun, baby.” [laughing] But all the other times, all the other times, I’m ArabAmerican. You’re not White in America, you have something before American. That’s how it works out. That’s just the way it is. [laughs] Okay. Unless you’re White. You’re just White. Everybody else, something right before American. Even Natives. Natives are natives. Native Americans. We got to identify… [laughing] …the Native Americans. African Americans. Most of my Black friends have never been to Africa. Nonetheless, they’re African Americans anyway. MexicanAmericans, AsianAmericans, and so forth and so on. Unless you’re White. If you’re White, you just sprouted from the corn fields of Ohio. [laughing] And you just spread across this great land. Unless it’s Saint Paddy’s day, then you’re like, “Oh, shit, my greatgranddaddy was a quarter Irish.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n [huffs] That’s what I am though, an ArabAmerican. And I got to say, as an ArabAmerican, I find it really fascinating to see our culture spreading throughout the West. Really fascinating. It is.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n It’s pretty damn cool. Like, if you don’t know what a hookah is, you’re like culturally ignorant. And if you don’t know what a hookah is… “You don’t know what a hookah is, Denise? Where have you been?” [giggles] “It’s like this bong, but it’s not. It’s like so ornate and it has all these different tobaccos flavors. And then there’s this pipe that comes out. And you just prrr.” “Blow it out, it’s so We can get two pipes and we can brrr together, Denise. Oh, my God.” [laughs] And then White people saw this, which is amazing. You got to give it up. They distilled it into a battery and put a cartridge on top of it with some mysterious liquid that nobody’s questioning. [laughing] Everybody just walk around like… [snorts] [growly exhale] [laughing] “It’s perfectly healthy.” “Bro, I’ve never seen that much smoke come out of a hookah.” [laughing] “Much less this little device.” “You’re changing weather climates on a regular basis.” “What the fuck is going on?” “No, it’s healthy.” [mock laughs] [snorts and growly exhale] “It can’t be, bro. It’s a metal with some battery hooked up to some metal. I’m sure you’re fucked.” “Please stop doing this.” [laughing] That’s the first public service announcement. [soft laughing] The second public service announcement, something that Redd Foxx actually tried to spread in America in the early 70’s. And I w',\n","  'ould say that most Muslims living in the West are all wondering why… nobody wash their ass. I’m just gonna say it. [laughs] [laughing]\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n It’s really weird. Please wash your ass. [laughs] It’s really weird that bidets are like not the norm, you know what I mean? Why is toilet paper the first and only option? It’s like, that’s it. It’s like leaves, toilet paper, baby wipes, and water. Why? Why would you do this? It’s obvio Everybody’s eating ass. Nobody’s washing their ass. It’s crazy. [loud laughing] It’s crazy. If you got shit on you, you’re like, “Oh, my God, I got shit.” You would wash it off right away. You’re like, “Oh, I’m okay now.” “I got the shit off of me.” But when you go, you’re like, “I’m fine.” And you just walk… [laughing] [huffs] My cousin came to visit me from back home. And he was like, “Hey, I want to try fivestar hotel.” I’m like, “Bro, of course. Enjoy yourself.” And he does it. And I said, “Hey, man, I’ll pick you up at noon at the mall. Next day.” He was like, “Okay.” And I picked him up the next day and I see him, he had this really upset look on his face. I’m like, “What’s going on, bro?” He was like this. I’m like, “What’s going on, bro?” He was like, “Allah Yoqrifhem”. “Allah Yoqrifhem”. I was like, “Bro, you can’t be yelling Allah in the middle of the Galleria Mall like this.” [laughing] “What are you doing?” “Relax.” “What’s the problem?” He goes, “They don’t have a bidet.” “They don’t have a bidet. Five star hotel!” “Not one star, two star, three star, four star, five star hotel! No bidet.” “Every time I go to the bathroom, I have to take a shower.” [laughing] “I’ve taken five showers today, Mo.” [laughing] “I’m more worried about your digestional tract, bro.” [laughing] “Five shits before noon. What are you doing?” [laughing] “Stop eating at IHOP, okay.” [laughing] My friend Nick came over. I upgraded all my toilets after my first Netflix special. Those Japanese toilets. And my friend Nick walks into the bathroom. He walks right back out. He’s like, “Hey, Mo, why does, uh, your toilet have a remote?” [laughing] I was like, “Oh, because it has a builtin bidet and blow dryer.” He was like, “What’s a bidet?” I was like, “You don’t know what a bidet is?” He was like, “No.” I was like, “Oh, my God, I failed you.” [laughing] I was like… I was like, “A bidet is once you go booboo, it sprays water up your around your ass and washes your ass.” His response to me was, “Ew.” I was like, “Ew?” I’m like, “Nick, you’re the ‘ew’ in this equation, bro.” Get in there and wash your ass.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n He was in there for like 20 minutes, man. He came out like he was baptized. He was like… He was like… [singsong] Ahahah!\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n He had a stride in his step. A new confidence I’ve never seen before. [laughing] Second public service announcement. The third one starts off with a question. Imagine it’s World War II era. Okay. Very important. Imagine it’s World War II era in America. And I’m walking around the States like, “Hey, would you like to try some of this sushi?” They’d be like, “Oh, what’s sushi?” You’d be like, “Sushi is a Japanese dish.” They’d be like, “Japanese!” “Get this damn Japfood out of my face!” [soft laughing] Probably what they would say. [soft laughing] Now imagine it’s September 12th, 2001, and I’m walking around the States like, “Hey, would you like to try some of this hummus?” They’d be like, “Oh, what’s hummus?” I’m like, “Oh, hummus is a very Arab dish.” They’d be like, “Arab!” [bash noise] “Get this damn sandniggaalQaidafood out of my face!” [laughing] It’s probably what they would say. [soft laughing] Here’s a very important clarification, the way you say it is “hummus”. It’s an “h”. It’s a “ha”. Okay. Jews, it’s not [Jewish accent] hummus. Okay. [Jewish accent] It’s not hummus. It’s not hummus. “Ghe” is a different letter in our alph',\n","  'abet. Okay. In our lang “Ghe” is a completely different letter. You don’t have the “ghe” in your language. So obviously it’s not yours. Back the fuck up. It’s our hummus.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Back up. It’s what it is. All right. And now hummus is everywhere. “Oh, I want some hummus.” Hummus, some shitty hummus everywhere. Fucking coffee shops have hummus. Seven Elevens have hummus. Every gas station, hummus, hummus, hummus. I was on a flight and the flight attendant comes up, “Would you like to have a little light snack?” I looked at it. I was like, “What the fuck is this?” She’s like, “This is hummus.” I was like, “No, it’s not.” This is a little juice box situation. You rip off a little corner and you get a little potato chip like this. And you squeeze it out. Just metaphorically shitting on my entire lineage. “Fuck your history.” That’s how it feels.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n That’s how it feels. “Fuck your grandmother with every shit of hummus that comes out of this thing. Ugh.” It’s not hummus. [soft laughing] I went to Trader Joe’s and they have those samples like, “Hey, would you like to try a some of this chocolate hummus? I was like, “What the fuck? It’s chocolate hummus.” [laughing] And then I just fainted like building seven. I just fainted. [soft laughing] We got to talk about it at some point. [laughing] Went to this South African fine dining South African restaurant when we were filming the movie in Atlanta. And the waiter comes over and he’s like, “Say, bra, we have some red bean hummus here.” I was like, “What the fuck did you just say?” He goes, “We have some red bean hummus here.” I was like, “Bro, are there chickpeas in this?” He goes, “Nah, bra, it’s red bean hummus.” I was like, “Bitch, hummus means chickpeas!” [laughing] This is refried beans, dog.\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n Frijoles refritos homie. “You’re pawning off Mexican food now?” “As hummus? Get this shit out of my face!” Hummus is very simple. It’s four ingredients, sometimes five. That’s all it is. You get your chickpeas, tahini paste, lemon juice, salt, sometimes garlic. Okay. You get your food processor out. It’s like a little science experiment. Put it all in there, you’re like… [blending noise] “No, no, no. More tahini paste.” [blending noise] “No, no, no. More lemon juice.” [blending noise] You’re like, “Fuck, it’s all lemon juice.” More chickpeas. More tahini paste. “Fuck, it’s all tahini paste again.” “More lemon juice.” [blending noise] Like, “Fuck, it’s all lemon juice. Needs salt.” “Chickpeas and tahini paste.” [blending noise] You’re like, “Fuck, more tahini paste.” You’re like, “Oh, that’s perfect.”\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Now you have 20 pounds of hummus right here. [laughing] [huffs] [laughing] This is very important. You scoop out the hummus and you put it in a bowl. Okay. You put the hummus in a bowl! You don’t put it on a flat plate. Nobody know how to dip on a flat plate, bro. You got like race track marks everywhere. [laughing] You got hummus coming over the sides. Complete chaos. You need a bowl to help you with the scoop situation. Okay. Now we’re not done yet. You got that bowl of hummus and you make a little crater right in the middle. Grab some fresh chickpeas, you put it right in the middle for texture. Okay. And then you grab some olive oil. Not that clear yellow shit. Some deep green olive oil. “Oh, what do I do with that?” “Do I just drizzle, a little drizzle of garnish?” “No, whore. You turn it over… [laughing] …and you hold it. Okay.” “One Mississippi, two, three, four.” “If you think it’s too much, it’s not enough. Keep it going.” [laughing] Okay. I like to finish it off with a little lemon juice. And some diced up jalapenos. And I put them on each corner like that. Now if I serve you this extremely authentic Palestinian hummus and you grab a carrot, I’m gonna fuck you up, okay. [laughing] “I just want to try it and I’m watc',\n","  'hing my carbs.” “It’s not for you, ho. Back the fuck up!” [laughing] You need some fresh hot, fresh hot steamy pita bread. You rip off a little corner like this. And you put it together. And it just binds because it’s so steamy. You make a perfect cone and when you dip, you dip like this… You dip towards yourself. You don’t dip out! You’re like, “Oh, I wanna taste like what it’s like on that side.” “Bitch, it’s the same hummus on each side. Okay.”\\r\\n [laughing and applause]\\r\\n “Nobody wants your stinky ass fingers in their hummus, all right.” “Oh, but I wanna taste what’s on that side.” “You know what, I’m gonna put a wall right in the middle of the hummus.”\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n “Put a wall right here.” All right. That side is hummus. This side is hummus. I was looking for a onebowl solution, but you won’t share, so BeTizik is what I’m saying.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n Thank you so much, Houston. I love you. Thank you so much.\\r\\n [cheering and applause]\\r\\n [Mo] Man, I love you all. Take a seat, take a seat. What a beautiful thing. What a beautiful gathering. I take all of this very, very seriously. I’m gonna tell you why it’s all so important to me. It took me 20 years to get my citizenship. It’s talked about in my first special. I am Palestinian and it was the first time I was able to actually go back to Palestine. [whoops and cheers] Because you’re not allowed, you’re not allowed to go back, even though my mother’s born there, my greatgrandmother’s born there, my grandmother, my greatgrandmother… We have a thousand years of history there. Still cannot go there until you get your US passport. And it’s still an obstacle when you get there, you know. When you first get there, like, “Where you from?” “Bitch, where are you from?” [laughing] And she said, “Uzbekistan.” It’s tough. It’s a difficult thing. You always think about going home. Your mom talks about it. You see my family back home. And you want to go see it. Don’t get me wrong, I’m saying “back home”, this is my home too. This is my house. My father is buried here.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n You understand?\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n [Mo sighs] So we went, for the first time I went to Burin, a little village short of Nablus, where my family is from. It was beautiful. I got to see my aunts. Amazing, cooking up feasts. This didn’t get here by no accident. [laughs] Some home cooking. You know. Sitting there with my aunts and I’m looking out over the landscape, thinking about my ancestors, thinking about my father, thinking about my history. I’m like, “Wow, I need to go to my grandparent’s house, who are no longer with us.” I was like, “I have to go to my grandparent’s house.” “I have to see where my mother was born.” “I have to see this, please take me over there.” So they take me over there. And I just sit and of course I had tears of joy and happiness. So much going on and we go to the rooftop. I’m like looking around. I’m like breathing in the air soaking it all up. I’m like, “Ah.” And I see these walls. These walls everywhere and it’s sad, but, you know. It is very sad and hopefully we can get past this at some fucking point. But I’m looking out into the village. I’m focused on the village. And I see this mosque in the middle of the village. And I look at my cousin, I was like, “How long has that mosque been there?” He’s like, “Hundreds of years. Like it’s been there for a hot minute, bro.” I was like, “I have to go pray there.” “I have to go pray there. I’m sure my father prayed there, my grandfather, my greatgrandfather. I have to go pray there.” He was like, “Let’s go.” So we go. And I prayed there. I was meditating. I was like, “Wow, what a beautiful thing, experiencing this. This is amazing.” And then these, like, five other guys were like, looked up at the clock and they were like, “Hey, man, it’s time for our Maghrib prayers.” I’m like, “What?” He was like, “Yeah, go do the call for prayer righ',\n","  't now.” I’m like, “Bro, I’m not gonna do the call for prayer. I just got here, bro.” [laughing] They were like, “But you have the beard.” I’m like, “Not you too, bro.” “I’m just fat. I don’t want everybody to see the chin. You know what I’m saying?” Then he’s like, “No, you have to do the call for prayer.” “The time is now and you have to do the call for prayer.” I’m like, “Bra, I’m not gonna do the call for prayer.” And they’re like, “You have to do the call for prayer.” And they’re like, “You don’t know the call for prayer?” I was like, “Yeah, of course I know the call for prayer.” “But I had to go and speak into that microphone, a little tiny little microphone.” “For the whole village, bro?” “I performed in front of thousands of people, but this is a lot of stress, bro. Scared to make mistakes.” “There are religious implications to this situation.” And they’re like, “No, you have to do it.” I was like, “Okay, I’ll do it!” And I walk up and I was like, “Cousin, be next to me because I’m nervous. Make sure I don’t mess up.” [sighs] So I do the call for prayer. Throughout the whole entire village. And I’m overcome. I was like, “Oh, my God, this is amazing.” “What is this thing that’s been written for me?” “I can’t believe this happened.” Right as I’m thinking this a man just crashes right into the mosque. [crash noise] “Who did the call for prayer?” Like this. And everybody sells me out. “This guy. This guy did the call for prayer.” [laughing] “This guy did the call for prayer.” I was like, “Forget you all, man. You forced me to do the call for prayer!” He’s like, “Why did you do it?” I was like, “I just told you they forced me to do the call for prayer.” He goes, “Well, you just did it ten minutes early, bro.” “You did it ten minutes early.” I was like, “That clock is flashing, man. It’s saying it’s time.” He goes, “That clock is ten minutes ahead.” I was like, “I didn’t know that. That’s a digital clock. Push the little buttons and it will fix the whole thing. Okay.” [laughing] “You want me to do it?” And he goes, “Wait, wait, wait, wait.” “I’ve been in the village my entire life.” “I know everyone in the village.” “Who are you? I’ve never seen you before.” “Who was your father?” I tell him who my father is. He goes, “Oh, my God.” He goes, “Oh, my God.” “Your father is Mustafa?” I was like, “Yes, my father is Mustafa.” He goes, “You know who installed the sound system in this mosque?” “Your father did.”\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n It was truly one of the most beautiful things I have ever experienced in my life. And I had to tell you this story. Because just because I’m Palestinian and I’m forced to live where I am, it’s not what it is. Houston is the city that raised me. And now Netflix is the label that pays me.\\r\\n [loud cheering]\\r\\n I love y’all. Thank you so much, Houston, I love you guys.\\r\\n [cheering and applause] [cheering]\\r\\n [quirky flute music playing]\\r\\n On September 16, 2021, Mohammed Mo Amer would be recognized for his work which continues to inspire, encourage, and of course make people laugh, while providing particularly unique and valuable encouragement to Arab-Americans and other artists from underrepresented minority communities.

The performance is not a traditional stand-up comedy special, as it was recorded at a private outdoor venue due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ohio and features long stretches without humor.\\r\\n The event was entitled\\xa08:46\\xa0in reference to the\\xa0eight minutes and 46 seconds\\xa0that police officer\\xa0Derek Chauvin\\xa0knelt on the neck of\\xa0George Floyd, a black man,\\xa0murdering him, and Chappelle’s time of birth on his birth certificate, being born at 8:46 AM.\\r\\n Chappelle touches on Floyd’s death and subsequent\\xa0protests, discusses the history of violence against African-Americans in the United States and their attempts to push back, and takes aim at conservative pundits\\xa0Laura Ingraham\\xa0and\\xa0Candace Owens\\xa0for their policing of the black community\\r\\n [car pulls up]\\r\\n [indistinct conversation]\\r\\n [music playing]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Thank you! Thank you very much!\\r\\n I hope you all can hear me.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Will you guys shut the fuck up!\\r\\n Just kidding! That’s my family in the back, that’s why I did that.\\r\\n Anyway, this is weird. And less than ideal circumstances to do a show. But the only way to figure out if this shit will actually work, well is to do the goddamn show',\n","  '.\\r\\n So, thank you all for coming.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I want to shout out all the young people who have had the courage to go out and do all this amazing work, protesting. [applause]\\r\\n I am very proud of you.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n You kids are excellent drivers. I am comfortable in the back seat of the car.\\r\\n So carry on, young ones.\\r\\n It’s hard to figure out what to say about George Floyd. So I’m not going to say it yet.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I will say something.\\r\\n [sigh] Are you guys having a good time, or is this weird?\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I gotta tell you, this is actually, like, the first concert in North America since all this shit happened, so, like it or not, it’s history. It’s going to be in the books.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n At least we tried.\\r\\n There’s other comedians that would– Well this is not the first show but the other shows were like in drive-ins and if people liked the n*gga’s jokes they’d honk the horn.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And that didn’t sound like any fun at all, did it?\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n So what’s you guys? You a black and white friend hanging out, do you guys know each other?\\r\\n [inadubile]\\r\\n Whew! It’s going to be a quiet ride home, isn’t it? No, just kidding!\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I’m just kidding, enjoy your riots.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I’m just kidding.\\r\\n They’re not really even riots. You notice that?\\r\\n [sighs] This is a fucking w',\n","  'eird time.\\r\\n Mhmm.\\r\\n In like 1993, I’m not sure what year it was, but I was in LA. I had smoked a joint and I was watching a movie, Apocalypse Now. It was like just after 4:00 in the morning. And what later would become the known Northridge earthquake happened. It felt like it started in my apartment.\\r\\n You know? I’m from east of the Mississippi. On this side we don’t know what earthquakes are about. I got to tell you something, man [burps]\\r\\n Excuse me, burping.\\r\\n This shit was terrifying. It was absolutely terrifying.\\r\\n Uh, a lot of things went through my mind, I was like, not naked, but you know what I mean, just chilling in my boxers. Uh, I put my clothes on, I found my weed. And some, a pipe, and a lighter and some money, and my keys, all these things, while the earthquake is happening, while I’m experiencing what an earthquake is for the first time, and I was certain that I might very possibly die. As a matter of fact, I remember I made a point not to scream, just in case I lived, I wouldn’t have to remember myself being vocally terrified. But I forgave myself for being terrified. That earthquake couldn’t have been more than 35 seconds. This man kneeled on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds! Can you imagine that!? This kid thought he was going to die. He knew he was going to die. ',\n","  'He called for his mother. He called for his dead mother. I’ve only seen that once before in my life, my father, on his deathbed, called for his grandmother. When I watched that tape I understood this man knew he was going to die. People watched it, people filmed it, and for some reason, that I still don’t understand, all these fucking police had their hands in their pockets.\\r\\n Who. Are. You. Talking. To!\\r\\n What are you signifying? That you can kneel on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds and feel like you wouldn’t get the wrath of God. That’s what is happening right now.\\r\\n It’s not for a single cop, it’s for all of it. Fucking all of it. I don’t mean to get heavy, but.\\r\\n We gotta say something.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n He told the police he couldn’t breathe.\\r\\n One of the hardest parts of the tape to listen to.\\r\\n He said, “Please!”\\r\\n I can’t tell you, as a man, watching another man go through something like that, what it makes you feel like. I didn’t watch the tape for a week. I didn’t watch it. I knew. I saw a still picture, I said, I don’t want to see this, because I can’t unsee it. But when I finally watched it, I understood, nobody’s going home. Anyone who sees this, well they’re going to be furious.\\r\\n So the other night, I’m in my little clubhouse. And I’m watching Don Lemon, that hotbed of r',\n","  'eality.\\r\\n He says, “Where are all these celebrities? Why aren’t you talking?”\\r\\n This n*gga said everybody. I was screaming at the TV: I DARE YOU SAY ME, N*GGA!\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I dare you!\\r\\n Has anyone ever listened to me do comedy?\\r\\n Have I not ever said anything about these things before?\\r\\n So, now, all the sudden, this n*gga expects me to step in front of the streets and talk over the work these people are doing? As a celebrity? Answer me, do you want to see a celebrity right now? Do we give a fuck what Ja Rule thinks? Does it matter about celebrity? No! This is the streets talking for themselves. They don’t need me right now!\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I kept my mouth shut.\\r\\n And I’ll still keep my mouth shut.\\r\\n But don’t think that my silence is complicit of all the shit these n*ggas are saying. Trying to get everyone to sing these fucking songs. I know all these songs.\\r\\n I was raised on these songs.\\r\\n Why would anyone care what their favorite comedian thinks after they saw a police officer kneel on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds? I can’t get that number out of my head because it was my time of birth on my birth certificate. I was born at 8:46 in the morning. And they killed this n*gga. And eight minutes and forty-six seconds.\\r\\n I watched everything everybody says. I see Candace Owens tryin',\n","  'g to convince white America, don’t worry about it, he’s a criminal anyway!\\r\\n I don’t give a fuck what this n*gga did. I don’t care what this n*gga did. I don’t care if he personally kicked Candace Owens in her stanky pussy. I don’t know if it stinks but I imagine it does.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And if I ever find out I’ll let you know for sure. I’ll tell like Azealia Banks, I’ll tell.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I’m the worst.\\r\\n But I know why. I figured out why they want to hear it from me, and it’s serious.\\r\\n The only reason people want to hear from people like me is because you trust me.\\r\\n You don’t expect me to think perfect. But I don’t lie to you. I’m just a guy. And I don’t lie to you. And every institution, every institution that we trust lies to us.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n How come they never talk about Chris Dorner?\\r\\n That’s a story about a man who believed he did everything right.\\r\\n Do you know who Chris Dorner is?\\r\\n Chris Dorner, if you remember, was an African American police officer in the LA PD.\\r\\n He was executing a warrant with his partner. Who was a white woman.\\r\\n And white women, I support you, but boy if you all don’t shut the fuck up.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n During the process of executing this warrant, this white woman did what Chris Dorner thought was excessive force. I don’t know what she did. She kicked the mother fuc',\n","  'ker that was handcuffed, or hit a guy that was handcuffed, or something. Chris Dorner, the Black police officer that watched this white woman do this, reported this to his superior. Made a formal complaint. And was subsequently fired from the LA PD.\\r\\n He went through the system.\\r\\n He took every legal avenue he believed he had to get reinstated.\\r\\n And he was not reinstated.\\r\\n And when his last appeal was finished, this motherfucker… some wild shit.\\r\\n Wrote a manifesto, you know where this is going.\\r\\n And in that manifesto, he called me a genius.\\r\\n Me. Dave Chappelle.\\r\\n Not just me, but me.\\r\\n He’s a Kevin Hart fan too.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n But he called me a genius. And he told Bradley Cooper who is a friend of mine, don’t do any more Hangovers, n*gga, that’s enough. That’s what he said.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And he told his story. Chris Dorner told his story, how he did everything right when he was in the military, and subsequently, this was before any of this shit happened, and then he said, which was the wildest thing, he said I’m going to wage asymmetrical war on the LA police department and their families. Well, that’s an ominous thing to say.\\r\\n And he did it.\\r\\n This motherfucker, ambushed two police officers who just sitting in their squad car. Murdered them. He went to another police officer’s house and killed ',\n","  'his daughter.\\r\\n Boy, it was terrifying.\\r\\n And this motherfucker was on the run. He was doing it. I was supposed to do the GRAMMYs. I was supposed to present at the GRAMMYs that week, and a guy from the LA PD called me and said, “Mr. Chappelle we understand you’re coming to Los Angeles, and I don’t know if you know, but there is a lunatic on the streets who is killing police officers and we would like to know if we can pick you up at the airport? We are extending this courtesy to everyone he mentioned in his manifesto. And I told the police, I’m fine. I read the manifesto, he likes me.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Is there anything I can do for you, n*gga? Because I get very worried!\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n They found him.\\r\\n Big Bear. He was hiding in a cabin. When they figured out where this n*gga was, no less than 400 police officers showed up and answered the call. And boy let me tell you something, they swiss-cheesed this n*gga. He is dead as dead could be. He is done.\\r\\n And you know why 400 cops showed up? Because one of their own was murdered.\\r\\n So how the fuck can’t they understand what’s going on in these streets?\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n We saw ourselves like you see yourself.\\r\\n They weren’t the only one.\\r\\n LeBron James once said something about racism and Laura Ingraham, which, I will say publicly anywhere, any time, is a cunt',\n","  '.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Tell ’em I said it.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Told one of Ohio’s greatest residents ever: “Shut up and dribble.”\\r\\n I’ll tell you something about LeBron.\\r\\n This n*gga was on the cover of Sports Illustrated when he was 17 years old, and exceeded every expectation that they had for him. This business is treacherous. This is a good guy LeBron, he’s a family man, and this, that and the other. He didn’t let anyone down. He didn’t let anyone down. Came back to Ohio, won us a championship, and then was like, I’m going to move to LA, and everyone in Ohio was like, n*gga we understand.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n He’s a good man, LaBron James. The bitch told my friend to shut up and dribble. My friend is the best at something, and this bitch is not the best at anything. Just a regular-ass white bitch with a platform. And I use the word bitch all the time because this is “black.”\\r\\n [sigh]\\r\\n Watch one shooting after another: Eric Garner in New York, the first guy that told the police, “I can’t breathe.” Eric Garner was selling loose cigarettes in Staten Island. When my kid was born, my first son, my wife lived in Staten Island, it’s an awful place. She knows it, everyone who’s ever been there knows it. Yuck, to Staten Island.\\r\\n And my black ass would go there, and I got a lot of fans there, and friends there, but this is ',\n","  'a very terrible place. Fuck everybody in Staten Island except the Wu Tang Clan.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Got murdered by one police officer while five of his fellow officers watched him do it.\\r\\n [no audio]\\r\\n Not one of them said, “Frank, Frank take it easy.” None of that shit. Because they were being recorded. Because they were afraid if I correct my fellow officer on this camera it’s going to open us up for some kind of liability. And the guy killed the person that they were, uh, what do you call it? Apprehending? The guy was selling loose cigarettes.\\r\\n There goes Eric Garner.\\r\\n [sigh] And then we have one after the other.\\r\\n Trayvon Martin gets murdered by just a regular n*gga that… George Zimmerman is nobody.\\r\\n George Zimmerman is an awful human being. He threatened Beyonce’s life, he threatened Jay-Z’s life, he signed Skittle bags because Trayvon Martin had Skittles on him when he was murdered by George Zimmerman. Boy, how do we feel?\\r\\n How do we feel right now? This kid was 15 years old being followed by a grown man with a gun and whooped his monkey ass. He beat the shit out of George Zimmerman and George Zimmerman murdered him, I’m very upset. This kid looked eerily like the president, he looked like my own children. I hate George Zimmerman. As an idea. Not as a guy, I’ve never met him. I’m sure I would thou',\n","  'gh.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Hit the streets. You got them marching. Dylann Roof. Dylann Roof killed eight people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. He prayed with them first, and then he shot them at point-blank range.\\r\\n It goes on and on. And in one weekend a law abiding citizen right here in Beaver Creek is murdered. The cop that murdered John Crawford pulled me over the night before and let me off with a warning. And the next day, kills a kid. He says, drop the weapon, bang bang bang.\\r\\n This kid didn’t even have enough time to register that he was the one being spoken to.\\r\\n This is our home town. It happened right here. I was very proud to be your neighbor, I love the way you guys hit those streets. We said his name and we tried to make sure everyone remembered him but he got lost in the sauce. And this guy John Crawford was a saint. He was there buying shit so him and his kids could make s’mores.\\r\\n Michael Brown got shot the same week, and Michael Brown became the story.\\r\\n And then, am I boring you?\\r\\n Well then, right back in Minneapolis was Philando Castile. Law abiding citizen, was a registered gun carrier, was trying to show police the paperwork for his registered weapon and was murdered in front of his wife and his child and then right in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, just two days later it happens aga',\n","  'in. And what do you think is going to happen? Three days later nine cops get murdered in Dallas at a Black Lives Matter rally.\\r\\n Wow, I’ll never forget it. It was the first time I ever thought, I gotta get my family the fuck out of this place. These n*ggas will never understand. I’m tired of explaining to these people something that’s so goddamn obvious.\\r\\n The guy that killed those nine cops, just like Chris Dorner before him, was from our military.\\r\\n And then right after he did it, another four cops were shot dead in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\\r\\n Again, a Black man, that served in our military. What are they doing? Why would our guys do that?\\r\\n Black people from the military? Because they believe, just like they did when they were joining the fucking military, that they were fighting acts of terror.\\r\\n These are our people. These are our countrymen.\\r\\n If I were white, and saw one of these men get murdered and I was in the NRA why wouldn’t I stand up for them. A card carrying legal gun owner that gets murdered in cold blood?\\r\\n Because he’s Black.\\r\\n That’s why they don’t give a fuck.\\r\\n There’s only one time the NRA ever supported an assault weapon ban.\\r\\n You know when it was? It was when the Black Panthers stormed the state capital with assault rifles in California.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Candace Owens, that rotten b',\n","  'itch.\\r\\n She’s the worst. I can’t think of a worse way to make money.\\r\\n The most articulate idiot I’ve ever seen in my fucking life. She’s so articulate she’ll tell you how fucking stupid she is precisely.\\r\\n And she told George Floyd’s wrap record…\\r\\n On the internet. “Oh, he was the this, he did that, and he was, he’s a drug addict. And he was not a hero. And why does the Black community make him a hero? Why do you chose him as a hero?” We didn’t chose him, you did! They killed him, and that wasn’t right, so he’s the guy.\\r\\n We’re not desperate for heroes in the Black community. Any n*gga that survives this nightmare is my goddamn hero.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n This is not funny at all.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I got some pussy jokes too, I could do, but I just really just…\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Slavery is a really wild concept.\\r\\n Uh, it’s some weird shit.\\r\\n The night that those nine police officers were killed felt like the end of the world.\\r\\n The only reason it wasn’t the end of the world, in my opinion, was because at the very same time that was happening, Kobe Bryant was playing his last game as an LA Laker. And as scary as all that shit was, I kept flipping back to see if Kobe would drop sixty, and he did. Oh, and he did.\\r\\n And vaguely in the back of my mind I remember the idiot ass bitch telling somebody to shut up and dribbl',\n","  'e, and I watched this n*gga dribbling and saving this goddamn country from itself. I loved Kobe Bryant. He died the night, the day I won a GRAMMY, he died.\\r\\n That’s why I didn’t show up at the GRAMMYs. Because Kobe died. They had both of his fucking jersey numbers hanging up. 8, 24. Well, that’s my birthday.\\r\\n I cried like a baby.\\r\\n [sighs]\\r\\n So, here’s what I said on Saturday Night Live that I got completely wrong:\\r\\n At the end of my set I talked about how few Black people were invited to the White House.\\r\\n How Frederick Douglass was the first. And that it didn’t happen again until Roosevelt.\\r\\n But that was wrong. It happened one other time before that. Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson received delegation of African Americans at the White House. They were from South Carolina. There was a man who was lynched for a $30 dispute at a grain elevator and they killed him because the n*gga was rich, and they hated him for being more welathy then they were, and they murdered him. And the people in South Carolina said, fuck that, and they went via the governor of South Carolina, it was a Black delegation that was facilitated to meet with Woodrow Wilson. That delegation was lead by the AME Bishop William David Chappelle.\\r\\n That’s where I get my name. It was my great- grandfather, who was a slave when he was born.\\r\\n',\n","  ' [applause]\\r\\n These things are not old. This is not a long time ago, it’s today. It’s today.\\r\\n That man’s wife was the woman that my father called on on his deathbed. And they were slaves.\\r\\n Are you out of your fucking mind if you can’t see that? And these n*ggas say why isn’t David Chappelle saying anything? Because David Chappelle understands what the fuck he is seeing. And these streets will speak for themselves weather I’m alive or dead.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I trust you guys.\\r\\n I love you guys.\\r\\n We’ll keep this space open.\\r\\n This is the last stronghold for civil discourse. After this shit it’s just rat-a-tat-tata-tat-ta-tat-tat-TAT!\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I love you very much, thank you for being here. Goodnight.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n ♫ Nobody Speak by DJ Shadow feat.

This is going to be my last special for a minute.\\r\\n [audience screams]\\r\\n It is all good. Listen to me. I did it in Detroit for that reason.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n That’s right. You wanna know why? ‘Cause I talked so much shit about Detroit in the first special I figured, I might as well, do the last special here. Sorry about that, by the way.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n First of all, before I even start, I’m gonna say that “I’m rich and famous.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n And the only reason I say that is ’cause the last 17 months were hell, and I cannot imagine what everybody went through. Well, I’m happy to see you and I’m happy you’re well and I hope everyone you love is okay.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n I don’t want you to worry about me, I’m… vaccinated, I… [audience laughs] got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I got to admit, that’s probably the most n*ggaish decision I’ve made in a long time.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I walk in to the doc like, “Give me the third best option.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I’ll have what the homeless people are having. So far, so good. And I know you probably heard on the news, I did get coronavirus. And it was something else. Like, okay first of all, when the doctor told me I had coronavirus I got to tell you, I was surprised how it made me feel. I felt dirty. [laughter] I felt gross. ‘Cause I’ve been walking around Texas just touching door knobs and shit, hands all moist. Tipping n*ggas with cash. “Here, take this to your family.” [laughter] I must have killed thousands of people. Just trying to get tonight’s show together so I hope you appreciate it ’cause a lot of n*ggas died for me to get this one off.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n I hadn’t felt that dirty in a long time. Last time I can remember, feeling dirty like that, man, I must have been a little boy. I was being molested by a preacher. [laughter] But don’t feel bad for me, I liked it. [laughter] I used to get a kick out of cumming in that fellows face.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n Well, he asked me to do it.\\r\\n They make you quarantine. I had to quarantine for ten days at least. They said “You’re gonna have to stay in the room,” I didn’t go nowhere. And it started making me nuts, ’cause I would just sit in the room and watch videos all day. Now, do you know what I was watching? And I hate to say this, but there was a lot of videos sadly, of Black people… beating up Asians for no reason. These attacks were unprovoked, I couldn’t believe it. And I was sitting in the room watching this shit, it would stress me out. I was stressed already because the whole time when you get coronavirus, at least the first five days you wait, and see how sick you’re gonna get. And it turns out, and this is true… I didn’t get sick at all. [laughter] Not a cough, not a booger, not a fever, nothing. Look at me I am the Magic Johnson of coronavirus.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n I just sat in the crib and got stronger all week. But I was stressed, ’cause I kept watching these videos of my beloved Black people beating up my beloved Asian people, and being so cruel. And the whole time I watched those videos, this is fucked up but I couldn’t help but feel like… When I saw these brothers beating these Asians up. It’s probably what’s happening inside of my body.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I didn’t get sick.\\r\\n I also saw a lot of videos of UFOs. I mean, what the fuck has been going on with that shit? This n*ggas are here. These UFOs keep coming to Earth and it made me think of an idea for a movie. Sounds dumb, but hear me out. In my movie idea we find out that these aliens are originally from Earth. That they are from an ancient civilization that achieved interstellar travel and left the Earth thousands of years ago. Some other planet that they go to and things go terrible for them in the other planet so they come back to Earth and decide that they want to claim the Earth for their very own. It is a pretty good',\n","  ' plotline, huh?\\r\\n [audience] Yeah! I call it Space Jews. [laughter] Space Jews.\\r\\n [man] We loved it!\\r\\n Alright. It’s going to get worse than that, hang in there.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n It is going to get way worse than that. Then I thought of an idea for a children’s book. I actually wrote it. It is coming out soon. The book is designed to help parents, teach their children about racism which, if you’re a parent you know is an impossible concept to teach to a child. But I’m doing it. The book is about a big, strong beautiful Black man with a benign, regular-ass White name… and he has a White speaking voice. So whenever this motherfucker calls to get a reservation at a restaurant, oh, he gets the reservation. [laughter] That name and that voice, who could resist him? Now I should tell you, this Black man is literally an actual giant. And he is a strong dude. And when he shows up to them restaurants they see that big giant Black dude they say “You can’t come in here.” And they call the police. And then every installment of the book the police come, and they always shoot him.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n But remember, no, remember this guy is a giant, these bullets don’t kill him, they don’t even hurt him. They just break his heart. It is called Clifford, the Big Black N*gga, anyone?\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n This is my last special, because I have an objective tonight. I came here tonight… because this body of work, that I’ve done on Netflix I’m going to complete. All the questions you might have had about all these jokes I’d said in the last few years I hope to answer tonight. And I would like to start by addressing the LBGTQ community, correct.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n And I want every member of the community to know that I’ve come here tonight in peace. [laughter] And I hope to negotiate the release of DaBaby.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n Sad story! DaBaby was the number one streaming artist until about a couple of weeks ago. Took a nasty spill onstage, and said some… said some wild stuff about the LBGTQ community during a concert in Florida. Now you know, I go hard in the paint but even I saw that shit was like, “God damn, DaBaby.” He pushed the button, didn’t he? He pushed the button. Punched the LBGTQ community, right in the AIDS.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Can’t do that. Can’t do that. But I do believe and I’ll make this point later that the kid made a very egregious mistake. I will acknowledge that. But, you know a lot of the LBGTQ community doesn’t know DaBaby’s history, he’s a wild guy. He once shot a n*gga… and killed him, in Walmart. Oh, this is true, Google it. DaBaby shot and killed a n*gga in Walmart in North Carolina. Nothing bad happened to his career.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Do you see where I am going with this? In our country, you can shoot and kill a n*gga but you better not hurt a gay person’s feelings. [laughter] And this is precisely the disparity I wish to discuss. I have a question for the audience and this is a real question, I am not joking around. Is it possible, that a gay person can be racist? [audience] Yes! Yeah!\\r\\n Do you really think so?\\r\\n [audience] Yeah! Of course it is possible. Look at Mike Pence.\\r\\n [audience laughs] [applause]\\r\\n I am guessing, but I bet you, he is gay.\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n [woman] Oh my God.\\r\\n And he is not pride parade gay either, he is sad gay. I feel bad for him. He looks like one of them gays that prays about it. Jesus, please take these dirty feelings out of my heart. [laughter] Please Jesus, make these buttholes ugly to me. I don’t want to keep on tasting these dicks. [laughter] Funny. You guys are confusing your emotions. You think I hate gay people and what you’re really seeing is that I’m jealous of gay people. I’m jealous, I’m not the only Black person, that feels this way. We Blacks, we look at the gay community and we go “God damn it! Look how well that movement is going.”\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n “Look how well you are doing.”\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n And we’ve been trapped in this predicament for hundreds of years. How the fuck are you making that kind of progress? I can’t help but feel like if slaves had baby oil and booty shorts… [laughter] …we might have been free a hundred years sooner. You know what I mean? If Martin Luther King was like, “I want everybody to get up on them floats. Get your bodies good and shiny.” I don’t hate gay people at all, I respect the shit out of you. Well, not all of you. I am not that fond of these newer gays. Too sensitive, too brittle. Those aren’t the gays that I grew up with, I missed them old school gays, n*gga. Them Stonewall n*ggas, them the ones that I respect.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n They didn’t take shit from anybody, they fought for their freedom. I respect that shit, I’m not even gay and I want to be like a Stonewall n*gga. Them old school, gangster gays. Them glory hole n*ggas, them the ones I like.\\r\\n [woman cheers]\\r\\n These new gays don’t even know what the glory hole is. It’s a hole in the wall, that gay contractors build. [audience laughs] You want to know why they put that hole in the wall? I’ll tell you, there is no nice way to say it. ‘Cause when they want to have some fun they will put their penises in that hole and hope for',\n","  ' the best. I respect that shit. It’s a lot of courage on both sides of that hole n*gga. [laughter] I’m not even gay and I want to try that glory hole out.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n What if Martin Luther King had to integrate the glory hole? “I don’t care if it is Black lips back there or White lips back there a mouth is a mouth. A warm wet mouth.” I’m going all the way. I got into a fight. I almost got into a fight, it is complicated. I was in a bar in Austin, with my wife and it was during Covid, and a woman came to our table and she was maskless, and this bitch came over, no mask, all “H” words. “Hi, how are you?”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Droplets was coming out of this bitch’s face. We all covered our drinks. Ew! Baby, what are you doing? Now I looked over the table that she came from, and I peeped game. The men at the table were filming me. This happens when you’re famous. People will come over and try to rattle your cage and get you to say something stupid or dumb so that their buddies can film it and get a video of you embarrassing yourself. And clearly I said, “This is what is happening.” And these dumb motherfuckers thought, it was my first rodeo.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Sadly it worked.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I ran right over there, I said… I pointed right in the camera I said, “You is a bitch-ass n*gga for doing this to me.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n And the dude was shocked that I said it. He said “Huh?” And when he did like this, I’ve seen all his fingernails is painted and I realized like, “Oh-oh.” [laughter] “This fellow is gay.” Yeah, you know how I talk. I call everybody a bitch-ass n*gga. You know what I mean? But that is not a right thing to do if they’re gay. You know what I mean? And now I was in trouble and not only that, the motherfucker was huge. He stood up, he was towering over me. He must have been 6′ 5″, a big White corn-fed Texas homosexual, this n*gga was ready to fight. And he started barking on me, but I stood my ground, I wasn’t scared. How could I be scared? This motherfucker’s shirt was tied up in a knot like this. Oh, fuck this guy. Let’s go, n*gga, let’s go. I thought we were going to come to blows. I was ready and then right when you think we would fight, guess what he did? He picked up his phone and he called the police. And this, this thing I am describing is a major issue that I have with that community. Gay people are minorities, until they need to be White again.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’m being very brutally honest, so we can solve this problem. I’m telling you right now a Black gay person would have never done that to me. ‘Cause a Black gay person knows, when the police shows up they’re not going to care who called ’em. They don’t show up like, “Which one of you n*ggers is Clifford?” [laughter] We’re all Clifford. This happens far too often. Another time, about six years ago, there was a lesbian woman that tried to sell a story about me to TMZ. Thank goodness, TMZ could see right through the sham of that story. This woman claimed that I beat her up in a night club because she was a lesbian. That is fuckin’ crazy. Bitch, I didn’t even know you was a woman.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n Thank God! TMZ didn’t believe that because I did beat the shit out of her, I am not gonna lie.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n It was her fault, I had no choice. I came into the club minding my own business and a woman came up to me, and she goes “Oh my God, Dave Chappelle.” And I was just being reciprocally nice. “Hey, miss, how are you?” Blah, blah, blah. Benign talk, nothing to it. And all of a sudden this lesbian fellow stepped between us. “Hey n*gga, that’s my girl!” I said, “Yo, my man, back up.” Like that. She said, “I ain’t backing up off shit, n*gga, that’s my girl!” I said, “Bro, you gonna have to give me three feet, like this.” She said, “Stop calling me a man, motherfucker.”\\r\\n I am a woman.”\\r\\n I said, “What?” [laughter] And then I looked deep in this n*gga’s cheek bones. And I said, “Oh my God, you are a woman.” This is too much for me to even wrap my mind around but I tell you what, I un-balled my fist immediately and I softened my posture so that she would know, she is in no danger. I even changed the tone of my voice. I said softly, sweetly, like a pimp might say. [laughter] “Bitch, I’m ’bout to slap the shit out of you.”\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n I should have done it. Oh, I wish I didn’t say that. She dropped that foot back, she was in a perfect southpaw stance. Her shoulders were angled correctly, her head movement was good, I said “Oh, no! this bitch boxes for real.” She threw a wild hook at me and I saw it coming from yesterday, so I slipped it like this… I had no choice, I had to go to work. I let that jab go, you should have seen me go n*gga. I tenderized them titties like chicken cutlets. [laughter] I whooped the toxic masculinity out of that bitch.\\r\\n [man cheers]\\r\\n That is why I don’t go out no more. Just trying to chill, I’m just trying to live a peaceful life. That’s why I live in Ohio, you know, I live in a little town in Ohio. Must be like 3700 people, small hippie town. Culturally you might feel like, like Ann Arbor to you. [laughter] You know what I mean',\n","  '? Bunch of hippies and shit like that. And n*ggas always ask me like, “Dave, why do you live in that hippie town?” And I’d be embarrassed to tell ’em the truth. Well, you know why I live there? Because Yellow Springs, Ohio has the most beautiful women in the world. And a lot of people might disagree with me but, you got to see them for yourself, they’re gorgeous. But it all depends on what you’re into. You know what I mean? I like White bitches with dirty feet.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n If I had a strip club in Yellow Springs, I would have called that shit “Strippies.” All naked hippies, all the time. And I would only hire girls with long titties and long vagina head that looks like they slept on it. And I would keep a pile of dirt, right next to the stage. I’d come up like, “Bitch get your feet in that dirt and get up there and give those people what they came to see.” “Chalk up, bitch.” Couple of years ago I was in Ohio, at a shopping mall. An old White lady… This is true, she was following me around the mall. Which sounds paranoid, but I’m sure she was following me. Mean lady too. You ever see a woman with lines on her face? That just tell you like… even if she’s smiling, it would look like it would hurt the muscles in her face. I knew she was following me, ’cause she was at places that had nothing to do with her I’d be looking around like, “What is this old bitch doing in Gamestop and Footlocker and all the places I like to go?” Every time I see her, she’d just be looking mean on me. And eventually I forgot about it. So, then after, I am shopping I go all the way to the back of the parking lot, I’m parked all the way in the back and as soon as I open my car door I hear a voice go, “David Chappelle.” Just like that. I didn’t even have to look, I knew it was her. And I looked back and sure enough there she was, that face. To be honest with you, she probably wasn’t even that old. She’s probably around my age. But she was a White woman, this bitch looked terrible. [laughter] I’m going all the way. I kept my cool, I was nice. I said, “Hello, miss.” And she didn’t say anything back, all she said was “I watch your comedy.” I said “Oh-oh.” And then she says, this is true, she goes, “Sounds to me… like you, hate women.” I said, “Well, you know what, miss? It’s art.” You are free to interpret this art however you like but I can tell you as the maker of this art that I don’t believe that I feel that way. And she said, “Well, I think…” And I said, “Shut up, bitch! Shut the fuck up!”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n “Before I kill you and put you in the trunk. Ain’t nobody around here.”\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n I’m just kidding, I didn’t say that. I felt that way, but that’s not what I said. I was more clever than that. You know what I said? And this is exactly what I said, I said, “Miss, before you finish that statement, let me ask you a question. Where did you see me? Did you buy a ticket to a concert I did, I doubt that. Or, maybe you watched one of my specials on Netflix. Or… Or… Did I follow you to your car and do my act?” She said, “What?” I said, “Keep it in the comments section, bitch, this is real life, ta-ta.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n And then I drove off. And now I got to tell you and this is gonna surprise some people here, but not everybody. People say things to me all the time but what you don’t know, is it does affect me. I think about it. And that one bothered me a lot, I was driving home, couldn’t stop thinking about what this woman said because she is not the first woman that said that to me. It’s puzzling. You know what I mean? Like, what could I possibly be saying… that would make these bitches think, I hate women. [laughter] Couldn’t figure it out. So, you know what I did? I Googled the dictionary definition of a feminist just to make sure, I was talking about the right thing. And do you know, sir, what the dictionary definition of a feminist is? I didn’t either, listen to this. Webster’s defines a feminist as a human being, not a woman, a human being, that believes in equal rights for women. I was shocked, ’cause that is what that meant ’cause by that definition I would consider myself a feminist, and I didn’t even know that at the time.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n All these years, I thought it meant frumpy dyke.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n Well, that seems always talking to be some… chick in overalls, “Men are trying to rape us.” “Ah, not you bitch, will you please…”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I know, look, listen, I support the feminist movement, I do in my own ways. Well, you guys did the women’s march, I tried to go and support you and none of my friends would go with me. I asked all the fellows, none of them wanted to go. I tried everything. “Come on y’all, there’s gonna be bitches there.” They was like, “Nope.” [laughter] So what I did is, I called my friend Anj. Anj is a Black woman who is a comedy writer and she’s dope. A matter of fact, a matter of fact, she’s the only woman, that I know personally that pays her ex-husband alimony. And she sounds just like a man when she does it. “Fuck that broke motherfucker” and all that, she says all that shit.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n So I hit Anj up, I hit her on the text and all ',\n","  'I did, I texted. I said, “Anj, are you going to the women’s march?” And she texted me back, and this is a real text, she said… she said, “I hope those White bitches get tear gassed.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n There is a problem in that feminist movement, isn’t there? From its inception in America there has always been a racial component. When Susan B. Anthony was having that meeting and Sojourner Truth’s Black ass showed up. Read your history books. All the White women asked Sojourner Truth not to speak. They didn’t conflate the issues of women’s rights and slavery. But you know how Black bitches are, so Sojourner Truth went up there anyway.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause and cheering]\\r\\n She did a famous speech, she said “Ain’t I a woman?” “Ain’t I a woman?” That’s right. And listen, listen, listen. I supported the “Me Too” movement, but the whole time, the whole time I thought that the way they handled it was stupid. [laughter] It was, it was White, it was like… they were doing shit, like going to the Golden Globes and all of them would be like “Let’s all go to the Golden Globes and wear black dresses. And give these men a piece of our minds.” Bitch, that is not gonna work. You think Martin Luther King is gonna be like, “I want everybody to keep riding the bus, but wear matching outfits.” [laughter] You got to get off the bus and walk. It’s real talk. A real talk, that was a silly movement. “I want everybody to wear crochet pussy hats so they know we are serious.” What the fuck was y’all doing? And then I said something about it in one of my specials and all these women actresses came after me. I said, “Man, fuck y’all too, you canceled. I ain’t jerking off to none of your pictures again.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n They were like, “Who is he to tell us anything?” I’ll tell you exactly who I am. I’m the one that got off the bus and left $50 million on the bus and walked.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n I agreed with these women. I just didn’t agree with what they were doing about it. Right. Right. No, it was annoying as fuck… because if these women were serious, you know what they would have done? They all would have fired their agents. And they would have went to the mailroom of one of these big agencies and found a woman that was bustin’ her hump in there and said, “If you want to talk to us then you have to talk to her.” And if they did that, then she would be big, and they would be big and nobody would get fed to Harvey Weinstein. But did they do that?\\r\\n [audience] No!\\r\\n No.\\r\\n Was that their idea? No. Surprisingly it was mine. What I think, the feminist movement needs to be very successful… is a male leader.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I’ll do it. I will. I will lead you women to the promised land. I will make sure you will get equal pay for equal work. I will make sure that nobody harasses you or fucks with you on the job. I will protect all of your interests. And all that I ask for in return… is that you suck my dick.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n And now, we’re right back to square one, aren’t we? And now we get to the core of the crisis. What… what is a woman? What is that, in this day and time? Is there even such a thing as a woman or a man or anything? Hmm. Hmm? Seems to be a question nowadays. Now listen, women get mad at me gay people get mad at me, lesbians get mad at me, but I’m gonna tell you right now, and this is true… these transgenders… the n*ggas want me dead.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I’ve gone too far, I’ve said too much. But I got to tell you, I’m very worried about it. I’m not even joking with you. Every time I come out onstage, I be scared. I be lookin’ around the crowd, searching. For knuckles and Adam’s apples to see where the threats might be coming from. A n*gga came up to me on the street the other day. He said, “Careful, Dave, they after you.” I said, “What?” “One they, or many theys?”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Before I even say anything about that community you must know and I hope you all feel the same way I am not indifferent to the suffering of someone else. There’s laws, the mean laws in our country. North Carolina passed a law once. They said a person in North Carolina must use the restroom that corresponds with the gender they were assigned on their birth certificate. No, no, no, no. No, that is not a good law. That is a mean law. No American should have to present a birth certificate to take a shit at Walmart, in Greensboro, North Carolina where DaBaby shot and killed a motherfucker.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n You have to ask yourself, if you’re thinking about it, who are these laws designed to protect? Like let’s say they designed this law to protect me, my interests, transphobic comedian, Dave Chappelle. Let’s say I’m in Walmart, doing a little shopping with my family. Now I should tell you if that ever happens in real life, you should know my dreams didn’t work out.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Well let’s say something goes horribly wrong and there I’m in Walmart with the poor Whites rummaging around for mediocre goods and services.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n And then I got to go to the restroom. So, I excuse myself from my family. I go to the men’s room. Now I’m standing at the urinal, taking a leak. And this is what this law is ',\n","  'gonna do. And suddenly a woman walks into the men’s room. I’m like, that’s strange. And then she stands shoulder to shoulder with me at the urinal, I’m gonna be like, “Bitch, what’s going on with you?”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And then she hikes her skirt up and she pulls a real live, meaty dick out!\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n What do you think I am going to say? Thank God, she’s in here with me. At least now I know my family is safe. Mm-mm. No, I’m not gonna feel that way at all, I’m gonna feel very uncomfortable. I would feel better if it was a man with a vagina that backed up to the urinal next to me. [audience laughs] I wouldn’t even think about that, I’d just be like, “That’s funny.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n “This guy is peeing out of his butt for some reason.” “Oh my God, he must be a Veteran, thank you for your service.” I’m not indifferent to people’s suffering ’cause I know it’s hard to be everybody. We Blacks, we just got our first big holiday in a long time. Happy belated Juneteenth to the Blacks.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Juneteenth is a strange holiday, isn’t it?\\r\\n [audience] Yes.\\r\\n It commemorates when Black people in Texarkana area of the country first found out that they were free. But remember, they were free when they found out. They just didn’t know it yet. Very interesting holiday. You know, I learned something This is a wild story. I learned this past Juneteenth of a story, this is true. And it’s that there was a Black man who was in South Carolina during slavery who somehow got granted his freedom by his so-called master. And when his master granted him the freedom he also gave him a plot of land. Now it turns out, this brother was brilliant. He had a good eye, good knack for farming. And he farmed this plot of land very successfully and made a lot of money, and this is where the story gets crazy. When he got all that money… this n*gga brought some slaves.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Have you ever heard this before? This is a true story. Not only was he a slave owner, he became a slave breeder. And employed tactics that were so cruel even White slave owners were like, “Yo, my man.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n He was a wild dude, but he did it just because that’s what successful people did at the time. He just wanted to be down, what a fuckin’ tragedy. How can a person that went through slavery perpetuate the same evil on a person that looks just like him. It’s mind blowing. And shockingly, they’re making a movie about him. Ironically… it is called Space Jews.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [cheers]\\r\\n Space Jews. [distant chuckling] The point of that story is this person was invested in a construct. That was the construct of successful people and he just followed the roadmap of successful people. He followed what they called “an incentive.” Now, everyone struggles but I’m very invested in the gender construct, personally. ‘Cause I’m a man with kids, and a wife, and I like that warm, wet soft pussy that my wife has.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n This does not mean that I feel like another point of view can’t exist. I was doing a night club in Oakland, 16 years ago and this was the first time that the trans community ever got mad at me that I knew about. And then I was nobody, I had just quit Chappelle Show. It was like a nothing hole in the wall club and I was doing some transgender jokes in Oakland, it was 16 years ago. My pronoun game was not as nice as it is today. I went too far, I said things like tranny and shit I didn’t know these words were bad, and a woman stood up and just gave me the business. Started screaming at me, and I’m sure it was a woman. But she kept calling me transphobic and all this shit I had never even heard these words before, it was really weird. I didn’t trip, I just gazed at Security to look like, “Go on, get that bitch out of here.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I kept it moving. And then she went to the press. The next day one of the gay papers wrote all of the same things she had said to me, about me in the paper. Misquoted the jokes, and was calling me transphobic you know, these words, I had never heard them before but every time that I talked with anybody from the community since they always repeat the talking points from that article. My least favorite of which being, I hate this phrase they say, “I was punching down on them.” “Punching down”, what the fuck does that mean? Now fast forward. It is 2019. And I am in a restaurant in Ohio, very nice restaurant. It’s Thanksgiving week. And to be honest, it is not a very nice restaurant, but it is a nice restaurant, if you’re a White person from Ohio that has never been anywhere before. [laughter] Picture Chili’s.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I’m sitting in the bar, I’m having a drink by myself and the only other person in the bar is a woman, a couple of stools down. And she was alone, and she was older, and that made me feel sad, ’cause it was the holidays. So, I told the bartender, “Send that woman a drink on me.” Just trying to spread the cheer, and I wish I didn’t. This woman wanted to talk. She wasn’t mean, she was nice, but she just wanted to talk about shit that you know, I mean a n*gga just trying to get drunk don’t want to hear about this bitch remodeling in her bathroom. ',\n","  'And I’m sitting there, trying to be polite. Oh, subway tiles? Word. But then she hits a lick. Piqued my interest. She says, “My daughter is coming home for the holidays.” Like, “Oh, that is great news, I’m glad you’re not going to be alone.” And then she goes on and on about how great her daughter is. I guess her daughter got a new agent and she is out in Hollywood, she’s in movies and on television and all this stuff and as she’s telling me this, I’m thinking, this woman is so sweet. She probably doesn’t even know who I am. Or what I do for a living because I know what your daughter’s is out in Hollywood doing.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And then she goes, “Would you like to see her picture?” “Oh now I don’t want to see this woman’s picture, but what am I gonna do?” I’m like, “Okay sure, I’d love to see the picture.” And I grab the picture and this is all I say, this is all I say, “Oh… she is very beautiful.” And as she puts the picture away she… looks mean all of a sudden, like she caught me in some kind of trap. “What did that face mean?” And then she goes, “She’s transgender.” And I think to myself, “Oh, this bitch does know who I am.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I really resented that trap because that trap doesn’t let me be honest. If I was honest, I wouldn’t have fallen for it. I’d have just looked at the picture like, “Look at that big chiseled jawline, that big thick Joe Rogan neck. Is that a dude? Is your daughter a man?” Can’t say that shit. It’s really annoying. Fast forward, now it’s a couple of days later. It’s the Wednesday… before the Thursday that’s Thanksgiving, and I’m in a totally different bar and this bar, trust me, is not a nice place. It’s foul, it’s one of those bars where the top shelf should be under the sink. [laughter] This is where the poor Whites drink. The Tiki torch Whites. You know what I mean? Them White people, they believe in “Q” and they love Trump. You know what I mean? Like Michigan White people.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I remember I was at this bar one time, it was that kind of bar it is. I was in there one time, I was fucked up and I turned around to everybody in the bar and go “Hey everybody, I am going to buy everyone in the bar a round of drinks.” And all the motherfuckers was like, “Hurrah!” And the bartender knew I was drunk, so she pulled me aside. “Mr. Chappelle, are you sure about that?” That’s going to be 16 dollars.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Tough time for the Whites. And this was a holiday weekend. You know what I mean? These motherfuckers were having a rootin’ tootin’ time. They was in there partying, making all them noises. “Ooh! Ow! Yeow!” You know all them noises White people make before lynching? They was doing all that shit. [audience laughs] I was drunk. I looked over my shoulder, I thought I was trippin’. Guess who was in the bar? I thought I was seeing things, I looked across the room and I saw… the trans-bitch from the picture. [laughter] I couldn’t believe it. I said “What is a trans person, doing in a place like this? This is very dangerous behavior.” And she was with, two big, buff, gay Black dudes. I didn’t know these dudes, but I know they was gay. If they had a dick in their mouth, they wouldn’t look any gayer than they did just sitting there. [laughter] They had 1980s gay face. You know what that is? Remember in the ’80s when gay people looked surprised all the time.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n “Close your mouth, n*gga, what is surprising”, you know what I mean? But they was huge, they looked like Jussie Smollett’s trainers.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And I am thinking, “Man these motherfuckers are in a lot of trouble.” So what I do is I stand up and everybody in the bar likes me, so I make a big show of it to make sure that everyone can hear me. Now, I walk right up to her, and I go “Hey! I just met your mother the other night and she told me all the great things you’re doing in Hollywood. And I cannot believe that someone from a podunk place like this can achieve all that, I’m so proud of you. Welcome home.” And the whole bar said “Hurrah!” And I said “Phew.” “That ought to buy her some time.” You know what I mean? A couple of more drinks and these fellows are gonna start asking her for some pussy, she might not have.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And she was very gracious. She said “Thank you so much”, and we shook hands and as she was shaking my hand, her face turned mean, like her mom’s. And she said, “Do you mind, not punching down on my people?” Oh, I don’t like that. Normally, I would’ve let it go, but I was drunk.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n I said, “What might you mean, bitch?”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I was careful to call her a bitch, ’cause I didn’t want to blow her cover. [audience laughs] Turns out she wasn’t hiding. She was loud, she was proud. She let me have it in front of everybody. Screaming at me, all the talking points from that article. You transphobic, this and that. Kept clapping her hands in my face. “Let me tell you somethin’.” I said, “Where did you learn this from, Black bitches?” She kept going, “Let me tell you something, honey.” So annoying. She kept calling transgenders, her people. Ain’t that weird? “My people this, my people that.',\n","  '” I said, “What do you mean, your people?” Were you all kidnapped in Transylvanian, brought here as slaves? [laughter] She said, “My people have struggled for decades, honey, decades.” And I looked at them gay Black dudes, like. “Is there anything you n*ggas need to tell this bitch? [laughter] Clifford, Clifford?”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I am exaggerating, she is actually a very nice person and I’m cool with her now, but boy, that shit got on my nerves. And it got on my nerves because, whenever someone says that to me I know they have never seen me for themselves, they just repeat what they’ve heard. Any of you, who have ever watched me know that I’ve never had a problem with transgender people. If you listen to what I’m saying, clearly my problem has always been with White people.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’ve been arguing with the Whites my entire career. Just when I thought I had you guys on the ropes you changed all the rules. “Oh yeah?” – Yeah, motherfucker! – “Well.” I am a girl now, n*gger. You must treat me as such.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n “Call me a girl, n*gger.” It’s annoying as fuck. No, no, go back, go back tonight after the show, watch every special I did on Netflix. Listen to everything I’ve ever said about that community. I’ll go through ’em. I said, “How much do I have to participate in your self image?” I said, “You shouldn’t discuss this in front of Black people.” I said, “I know n*ggas in Brooklyn that wear high heels just to feel safe.” I asked you “Why is it easier for Bruce Jenner to change his gender than it is for Cassius Clay to change his name?”\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n If you listen to what I’m saying, I’m not even talking about them, I’m talking about us and “they don’t listen.” It’s very annoying. And they have canceled people, more powerful than me. They canceled J.K. Rowling, my God. J.K. Rowling wrote all the Harry Potter books by herself. She sold so many books, the Bible worries about her.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n And they canceled it because, she said in an interview and this is not exactly what she said, but effectually she said that gender was a fact. And then the trans community got mad as shit, they started calling her a TERF. I didn’t even know, what the fuck that was. But I know that trans people make up words to win arguments. [laughter] So I looked it up. TERF is an acronym. It stands for Trans-exclusionary radical feminist. This is a real thing, this is a group of women… that hate transgender. They don’t hate transgender women but they look at trans women the way we Blacks might look at Black face. It offends them like, “Oh, this bitch is doing an impression of me.” [laughter] Now I shouldn’t speak on this because I’m not a woman nor am I a trans. But as we’ve established… I am a feminist. [laughter] That’s right.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’m team TERF. I agree. I agree, man. Gender is a fact. You have to look at it from a woman’s perspective. Look at it like this, Caitlyn Jenner whom I have met, wonderful person. Caitlyn Jenner… was voted, woman of the year. Her first year as a woman. Ain’t that something? Beat every bitch in Detroit. She’s better than all of you. [laughter] Never even had a period, ain’t that something? [laughter] I’d be mad as shit if I was a woman. I’d be mad if I was me. If I was in the BET awards, sitting there and they’re like “And the winner for n*gger of the year… Eminem.” My man. [audience laughs] Gender is a fact, this is a fact. Every human being in this room, every human being on Earth had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on Earth. That is a fact. [laughter] Now… I am not saying that to say, that trans women aren’t women. I’m just sayin, that those pussies that they got… You know what I mean?\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’m not saying it is not pussy, but that’s like Beyond Pussy or Impossible Pussy. You know what I mean? It tastes like pussy but that’s not quite what it is, is it? It’s not blood, that is beet juice. [laughter] Oh buddy, I’m in trouble now.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n Before I go, I want to share this story with you because it is important to this point. I want your community to know that one of the coolest people I ever met was a transgender woman. And this is not a man that I knew that became a woman, this woman was trans when I met her. Lived in San Francisco, Daphne Dwarman is the name. I would do 18 shows in the Bay Area sometimes in Oakland and Dirty Hood night club and she would be there, white trans woman, laughing loud and hard, at everything I said. Especially the trans jokes, very puzzling… because she was obviously trans. And one night after one of the shows I met her. And what it was, turns out it was her dream to be a comedian. And I was her hero. It was very moving. I could not dislike somebody that felt that way about me. We became fast friends. And when I made that special Sticks and Stones right as it was coming out, I happened to be in San Francisco and I wanted to do a show. But I needed an opening act, and I remembered… that trans woman I had met, so I called her on the phone. And I called her myself, I said, “Hey Daphne, this is Dave Chappelle.” She couldn’t believe it. And ',\n","  'I go, “I’m in San Francisco.” And then she started saying a bunch of wild stuff, I was like “Relax now, I don’t want any pussy, I was… [laughter] I’m just calling, because I’m doing a show and I need an opening act. And I was wondering if you’d open the show?” And she was like, “Fuck, yeah.” Now… I didn’t know this at the time but this woman had only done stand up comedy eight times in her life. This was little to no experience and now she’s about to open a show for what many call the GOAT.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n She’s an amateur in stature, but in practice, she was very professional. She showed up early, which is something I appreciate ’cause I like people to be on time. She was dressed to the motherfuckin’ nines, I mean, I’m transphobic and even I was like, “You look nice.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Went up on the stage with all the swag of a professional comedian, grabbed that mic and walked right down the middle and looked at the crowd like a gangster. Man, you should have seen her work. This bitch bombed for 45 minutes, straight.\\r\\n [cheers]\\r\\n And I’m not exaggerating, young man. That show was terrible. Stunk. Stunk. And then she brings me on, and you know, I was like a glass of water after a handful of salt. The crowd was happy to see me. I was killing it. But here is what impressed me. Any other comedian I’ve ever seen, if they had bombed as bad as she did, would have snuck out of the back of the theatre and went home and cried or something, but she didn’t do that. Not only did she not leave, she found a seat, right up in front. You know, when a new comedian watches an experienced comedian in comedy we call this “taking class.” And this bitch took my whole class, she sat up there and was laughing as hard as she always laughs as if nothing bad had even happened to her. And I saw her show. Something bad happened to her.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n She was drunk. So she starts talking to me, while I’m onstage but the way a person would talk to a television when they were alone. She was talking to me like that. That didn’t bother me ’cause I knew her. But the crowd didn’t like that shit at all ’cause she sucked. And a guy in the back of the room stood up and Daphne’s hair was dyed blonde at the time and the guy screamed out, and his energy felt wild as fuck. He said, “Hey Daphne!” and everybody got clamped, they got tense. We didn’t know who was a heckler or active shooter, and… [laughter] …he said, “Does the carpet match the drapes?” It was fucked up. The whole crowd kind of groaned, ’cause it was so like, mean. Everybody groaned, except for Daphne. She kind of laughed, which was weird. And she didn’t even look all the way back. She said, “Sir, I don’t have carpets I have hardwood floors.” Just like that. [laughter] Just like that.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Boy, when she said that shit, it blew the roof of the place. Cut through all the tension, with that one joke. She had made up for 45 minutes of a stinker of a show. And after that, she could do no wrong. And I kept on rocking, and she kept on talking to me. And then the show became something cooler than a show. It became like a conversation between a Black man and a White trans woman and we started getting to the bottom of shit. All of them questions that you think about that you’d be afraid to ask, I was just asking them and she was answering them and her answers were funny as shit. The crowd was falling out of their chairs and at the end of the show, I go, “Well, Daphne”… I said “Well, that was fun.” I go, “I love you to death, but I have no fuckin’ idea what you’re talking about.” The whole crow laughed except for Daphne. Man, she looks at me like I’m not her friend anymore. Like I’m something bigger than me, like I’m the whole world in a guy. Then she said, “I don’t need you to understand me.” I said, “What?” She said, “I just need you to believe…” Just like that she goes, “…that I’m having a human experience.” And when she said it the whole crowd kind of gasped. And I gave the Fight Club look. I said, “I believe you, bitch.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Because she didn’t say anything about pronouns. She didn’t say anything about me being in trouble. She said, “Just believe I’m a person and I’m going through it.” I know I believe you, because it takes one to know one.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Then I told the crowd “Good night.” And they started going crazy and before the applause gets to it’s crescendo I was saying, “Don’t forget my opening act, Daphne.” And the crowd stood up. And I looked at her, tears came out of her eyes she couldn’t believe it was happening. I couldn’t believe it was happening ’cause her show stunk. [laughter] And it was a great night. And I remember, the late great Paul Mooney was there bunch of flyers, comedy n*ggas was there.\\r\\n [cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n And we all went backstage and was just drinking and talking shit and laughing and Daphne stole the room, she had everyone cracking up. Spinning the yarn, telling us all these crazy stories about shit, she’d be into. We all laughing real hard, and there she is telling us and everyone is laughing. I’m looking around, I’m like, “Oh my God, she is funny.” I pulled her aside, I said, “You’re h',\n","  'ilarious. I didn’t know that when you were onstage.” [laughter] I said, “You’re doing some things wrong but I can help you.” I said, “Anytime I’m in San Francisco why don’t you open the show for me and I’ll just try to give you some pointers and see if you can work this thing out.” She said, “Are you serious?” I was like, “Yeah.” And she grabbed me real tight, hugged me, squeezed me. And I pushed her off violently, ’cause I’m transphobic. I said “Boundaries, bitch!”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n When Sticks and Stones came out… a lot of people in the trans community were furious with me and apparently they dragged me on Twitter. I don’t give a fuck, ’cause Twitter is not a real place.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n And the hardest thing for a person to do is go against their tribe if they disagree with their tribe, but Daphne did that for me. She wrote a tweet that was very beautiful and what she said was and it is almost exactly what she said. She said, “Punching down on someone, requires you to think less of them and I know him, and he doesn’t. He doesn’t punch up, he doesn’t punch down he punches lines, and he is a master at his craft.” That’s what she said.\\r\\n [audience cheers]\\r\\n Beautiful tweet, beautiful friend, it took a lot of heart to defend me like that, and when she did that the trans community dragged that bitch all over Twitter. For days, they was going in on her, and she was holding her own ’cause she’s funny. But six days after that wonderful night I described to you my friend Daphne killed herself. Oh yeah, this is a true story, my heart was broken. Yeah, it wasn’t the jokes. I don’t know if was them dragging or I don’t know what was going on in her life but I bet dragging her didn’t help. I was very angry at them, I was very angry at her. I felt like Daphne lied to me. She always said, she identified as a woman. And then one day she goes up to the roof of her building and jumps off and kills herself. Clearly… only a man would do some gangster shit like that. Hear me out. As hard as it is to hear a joke like that I’m telling you right now, Daphne would have loved that joke. That is why she was my friend.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n I was reading her obituary and I found out, she was survived by a daughter. And the moment I found that out, and this is true Anderson Cooper from CNN texted me. And all he says, it’s very nice, he said, “I’m sorry to hear about your friend.” And I texted him right back. “New phone, who this?” [laughter] He said, “It’s Anderson Cooper.” Oh, I said, “Anderson, look I need to find her family.” And he texted me right back with all the phone numbers and all this information. I say this to say, if you ever want to know about anything gay call Anderson Cooper from CNN. This n*gga is faster than Google. [laughter] What I did is, I got in touch with her family and I started a trust fund for her daughter ’cause I know that is all she ever really cared about.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n And I don’t know what the trans community did for her but I don’t care, because I feel like she wasn’t their tribe, she was mine. She was a comedian in her soul.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n The daughter is very young, but I hope to be alive when she turns 21 ’cause I’m going to give her this money myself. And by then, by then, I’ll be ready to have the conversation that I’m not ready to have today. But I’ll tell that little girl, “Young lady, I knew your father… [audience laughs] …and he was a wonderful woman.”\\r\\n [cheers]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Empathy is not gay. Empathy is not Black. Empathy is bi-sexual. It must go both ways. It must go both ways.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Remember, taking a man’s livelihood is akin to killing him. I’m begging you, please do not abort DaBaby.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Kevin Hart dreamt his entire life of hosting the Oscars and when he finally got the job they just took it! It’s not fair. They didn’t kill him, Kevin is a strong guy. But I’m sure it broke old Clifford’s heart. It’s over. LBGTQ, L-M-N-O-P-Q-Y-Z, it is over.

Seeing the quotes even with context- this shit is transphobic, plain and simple\\r\\n Did you get to the part at the end where he’s defending a trans comedian and pointing out how much of a great human being she was? Watch the special.\\r\\n You dont stop racism by being racist.  You do it by being the best human being you can be, so when any race sees you, they see the best of who we all are.  When every thousand people like you become become like i just described, the way you described them goes away into the background and those one thousand do not think what color they are when they are on stage, like you do when you are with this kind of material.  I know you hurt, but making money telling your audience how racist you are against other racists is admitting you are not willing to stand on your own, but just preaching to the crowd.  Everybody is clapping cause you are putting down people who are putting down people. You cannot build people up by putting down those you are putting down.   None of your script shows you have material to make your world better for your audience. Tell me what good does that do?  You are just agrreing with your black audience that white racists are no different than you are; just trading colors. Show your audience you are better than white or black racists. “Red and yellow, black or  whit, they are precious in His sight. Jesus  loves all the children of the world!”  Prove this is so by loving them all unconditionally.  just as you would like to be loved.  Give us humor so we do not think skin color at all.  And if you are funny or not, we won’t.\\r\\n w\\r\\n Couldn’t disagree with you both more. Dave Chappelle is smarter than the average Bear.\\r\\n No one is saying he isn’t smart. If he was just dumb I’m not sure many people would care. Smart people still do bad things and latch on to harmful ideologies. His being smart enought to make his argument appealing is part of the problem. It is clear here that with few exeptions this set is designed to otherize, demonize, discredit and slander the LGBTQIA+ Commmunities. He designed it to exclusively, claim for himself the mantle of victim and erase any intersectionality that doesn’t support his argument.\\r\\n Agree. What doesn’t translate is the joke delivery and the sarcasm.  Brings so many hard subjects to light and makes the audience FEEL it, even if it’s uncomfortable. I’ve hated the way he uses certain words, but the delivery is spot on.  I appreciate that he’s willing to have real discussions.\\r\\n Seeing the comments, it seems to me that trans activism (as opposed to a trans person) is dishonest, stupid, and nasty. I had a lot of sympathy for the LGB community when they fought for their rights because their arguments made sense and their cause was just. I thought I felt the same way about the transgender cause when they fought for the right to be who they wanted to be, but then it was no longer about them or about protecting people but about persecuting people, making stuff up in order to persecute people, and ignoring facts when the facts are not convenient. \\r\\n Arguably, Dave Chappelle offended White people, Black people, Asians, Women, Jews, Texans, and many others in his special, but it is significant that only the Trans community took serious offense – not because his words endangered them or denied them their rights but because his narrative was different to their narrative – and that it was not enough to allow them to be who they wanted to be, he had to also stick to their talking points or he would be deemed offensive.\\r\\n The central premise of many minority causes is that there are many different perspectives, e.g. being Black or Latino or Asian is just as valid as being White; being Gay or Lesbian or Bi is just as valid as being Heterosexual. But Trans activism seems to have taken two paths – one path advocates the validity of being Trans, whereas the other goes beyond self-identity to insist on policing the meaning of words and the perspective of others (in short, rejecting the diversity of views and opposing views). It is not a good idea to use the One Ring to create your ideal society. There are different views on gender (Dave Chappelle also makes this argument), and if the Trans-radicals insist that there is only one correct view, then they are not much different from the Church groups and ot',\n","  'hers who also insist that there is only one correct view of gender, and then it simply comes down to power politics to determine who gets their way.\\r\\n If the “opposing view” is saying to a trans woman “you are not a woman” or a trans man “you are not a man”  then yeah that’s some Karl Popper emergency level we are one step away from genocide level intolerance that cannot be tolerated. Just look the fuck around at how hatred of trans people is the salking horse for all manner of societal opression. Did you read HB@ in NC? there is all kinds of hateful shit in that bill that doesn’t have anything to do with Trans. And let’s not pretend for one second we don’t know who Chapelle’s tired tirade benefits most. White.male.patriarchy.\\r\\n With context, Chappelle is clearly an ally. He specifies not only that trans women are women, he APOLOGIZES about using the T slur. He obviously does more in the show to clarify his viewpoints, but to me, these are the key points of interest. A transphobe would never apologize for using to T slur. In fact, they’d use it a lot on purpose. He is an ally to the LGBT community. We cannot allow people to ruin someone’s career over poorly paraphrased words.\\r\\n no one is ruining his career…this comment is laughable. Exactly how is he an ally?\\r\\n This man is up front and caring. He’s the little boy in the emperor has no clothes story.\\r\\n Personally  I think Mr.. Chappell  is more vulgar than amusing but there are those that enjoy his type of humor. As a fellow human he is entitled to his views and as long as there is an audience willing to pay to hear those views nobody has the right to try and cancel his career.\\r\\n Applause-break comedy is the fucking worst. It might as well have been the Late Show with Steven Colbert\\r\\n Have you ever been to a stand up show where the comedian didn’t pause for applause? You’re delusional.\\r\\n Without the delivery, this reads as surprisingly insecure.\\r\\n That was actually worse than I thought it would be. And I was expecting it to be pretty bad, after seeing his first comeback special, which had poor material, and poor delivery. He keeps trying to act like he’s ignorant when he was raised by two damn professors. It’s pretty clear the audience he’s trying to appeal to – reactionaries. 16 years ago, he left his own show because he decided to draw a line. People like me supported his decision, even though that sudden decision made it hard for everybody else working on that show. Now he’s trying to do his comeback, appealing to these reactionaries, he’s claiming nobody else is allowed to draw a line. His new audience laps it up, and doesn’t question him for a moment. It feeds his ego, and his bank account. Doesn’t achieve anything else. Not deep enough to be philosophy, not funny enough to be comedy, it’s just a middle-aged cis guy ranting about how hard he’s finding it to progress. I could walk into most bars and get the same for free.\\r\\n Chappelle makes it clear that he needs Dorman to exist on his terms, not hers — not as a trans woman with autonomy, but as a trans woman who’s proven she deserves autonomy by way of having a chill, laid-back sense of humor. Furthermore, in repeatedly reducing Dorman’s existence to her body parts and her relationship to them and the language surrounding them, Chappelle dehumanizes her and dehumanizes other trans people.\\r\\n Dorman’s fate — she died by suicide shortly after the release of Sticks and Stones in 2019 — directly undermines Chappelle’s logic. Because Dorman was trans, she was at an extremely high risk of dying by suicide or transphobic violence. Any way you look at it, trans people are among the most vulnerable populations in society:\\r\\n Out of all hate crimes that result in homicide that target LGBTQ and HIV-affected people, 72 percent of the victims are trans women, according to 2013 data.\\r\\n 50 percent of trans people will experience sexual assault or abuse in their lifetimes; this number is even higher for Black trans people.\\r\\n 54 percent of trans people experience intimate partner violence.\\r\\n Trans people of color are six times more likely to experience police brutality than white cisgender people.\\r\\n 10 percent of trans people experience violence from a family member after coming out as trans. Eight percent of trans people are kicked out of their homes after coming out.\\r\\n 30 percent of trans people experience homelessness at least once in their lives.\\r\\n In 2015, 30 percent of trans people reported experiencing workplace harassment, including sexual assault, physical harassment, or being fired for their gender expression.\\r\\n More than 50 percent of trans teens seriously considered suicide in the last year; more than 66 percent of trans teens experienced major symptoms of depression within the two weeks prior to the survey.\\r\\n This is what Chappelle’s critics mean when they discuss the real-world impact of Chappelle’s transphobia. His comedy, which involves continually insisting, against science, that gender is always tied to biology, isn’t just reactionary semantics. It’s dangerous rhetoric that’s been shown in study after study can directly impact the levels of anti-trans violence and societal prejudice that tr',\n","  'ans people already face daily.\\r\\n It’s important not to omit this reality from the equation — which is what Chappelle does when he treats Dorman as though she’s a comedian first and a trans woman second.\\r\\n Chappelle seems to think all trans people should have the attitude of comedians like Dorman\\r\\n Chappelle views comedians as their own “tribe.” In The Closer, he even claims Dorman for his own “tribe” and not for the trans community: “She wasn’t their tribe, she was mine,” he says. “She was a comedian in her soul.”\\r\\n Chappelle’s not just talking about comedy as a medium here, he’s talking about comedy as a worldview. Comedy is a subculture, after all, with its own very particular set of rules and mores. Perhaps the chief rule is the one comedians tend to embrace the hardest: Always, always be able to take a joke.\\r\\n In the past, this principle has led to the privileging, within the comedy community, of the comedian’s right to make rude, disturbing, or even heinously offensive jokes. The logic goes that if the comedian can take a joke, the audience should be less sensitive, too. (See, for instance, the notorious moment in 2012 when a comedian heckled a woman in the audience who reacted to a sketch about rape jokes by making a rape joke about her.) Much of the recent cultural conversation over comedy and free speech has centered on the idea that comedians should be able to discomfit their audiences, whether in the service of making them laugh or making them think, without backlash — and that if you can’t handle a joke that makes you uncomfortable, that’s your problem, not the joke-maker’s.\\r\\n Dorman herself was adept at taking an offensive joke. As Chappelle recalls, when an audience member interrupted one of Dorman’s shows with a transphobic question, she shot back by making an even better joke about her own anatomy. This, Chappelle wants us all to know, should be the response when we’re confronted with transphobia: not anger, hurt, or pain; not a walkout in protest of Netflix, but good-humored deflection.\\r\\n This rule applies, at best, within the realm of comedy, between a comedian and their audience, not to the lived experiences of people in their everyday lives. Chappelle seems to need all trans people to accept the mores of his own very specific professional subculture, and he makes this request sound reasonable — he’s just a guy wanting to be allowed to make transphobic jokes without getting canceled for it, geez — but in practice, it’s baffling. Most people aren’t comedians, and most people are sensitive to jokes designed specifically to hurt them. Chappelle’s idea that trans people should have to prove, like Dorman, that they can take a joke without getting offended before they’re worthy of respect is a bit like a journalist demanding trans people prove they can use AP style before allowing them to command a conversation about their own gender identity.\\r\\n What’s more, if “always be able to take a joke” is sacrosanct, there’s another rule that comedy holds just as dear: the one about never “punching down.” In comedy, punching down refers to humor that targets vulnerable groups of people who don’t hold much power in society. It exists in opposition to the kind of “punch up” that aims to critique people and institutions with power. Onstage, punching down is generally considered a huge “No” — the kind of thing that can immediately alienate an audience if you’re not doing it to make a deeper point. (Chappelle talks about this concept in The Closer, asking the larger LGBTQIA community not to “punch down” on his people, using Kevin Hart and DaBaby as examples.)\\r\\n Chappelle’s deeper point seems to return again and again to the idea that trans people are too sensitive and that this sensitivity is somehow bolstered by white fragility. He seems to feel that his prioritization of the pain of Black communities over those of trans communities — as if, again, they are entirely separate — justifies an evening devoted to homophobic and transphobic jokes. Because Chappelle seems to believe that all queer and trans people have white privilege, he views himself as punching neither up nor down and even quotes Dorman as suggesting as much.\\r\\n But Chappelle, of all people, should know better. He’s hyper-aware, as a comedian who frequently uses humor to make points about racial and social justice, that comedy impacts the real world. In fact, in 2005, Chappelle completely killed his own hit comedy show, the legendary Chappelle’s Show, because of one joke that made him realize, according to an interview he gave to Time, that rather than critiquing racist comedy, he might instead be reinforcing racist stereotypes for white audiences who were enjoying the joke unironically.\\r\\n At the very least, then, Chappelle should know that there’s a possibility his jokes about trans people could be taken the wrong way and used to hurt trans people. There’s even an echo of the 2005 moment in the new special, when Chappelle has to stop and gently reprimand an audience member who starts to applaud a transphobic law. As Vulture’s Craig Jenkins put it, “You talk enough shit, and you’ll draw flies.”\\r\\n Rather than acknowledging this possi',\n","  'bility and its potential for harm, Chappelle not only justifies his comedy using white privilege, but seems to go a step further: He suggests that being hurt is good for trans and nonbinary people. When he says, “As hard as it is to hear a joke like that,” and then follows it up with any kind of defense, he’s telling audiences that he knows the joke is painful, hurtful, and transphobic — but that it’s somehow productive for trans people to be confronted by it. That it’s a learning experience to be confronted with transphobia onstage, as though trans people aren’t confronted with gender policing in every other moment of their lives.\\r\\n Only then, in Chappelle’s telling, can Chappelle and trans people “[start] getting to the bottom of shit.” Once trans people have shown him that they’re capable of being good-humored about other people’s continual objectification and degrading dismissal of transgender identity issues, they can — on the terms of the person using transphobia to interact with them — be heard and accepted and loved.\\r\\n This isn’t equality. Chappelle, who’s spent his entire comedy career using humor to make sharp, trenchant commentary on racism and injustice, should know that. Trans people should never have to just live with or get over or get used to rhetoric that dehumanizes them. The man who speaks viscerally about the fear Black Americans experience daily should know that asking trans people to accept and embrace transphobic ideology isn’t tolerance. It certainly isn’t the love and good humor he wants to be credited with.\\r\\n And despite the audience laughing with Chappelle, it’s not funny at all.\\r\\n Correction, October 25, 12:15 pm: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that trans women comprise 72 percent of all hate crime homicides. It has been corrected to state that trans women comprise 72 percent of hate crime homicides targeting LGBTQ and HIV-affected persons.\\r\\n Jenny, a very well-constructed essay!  You make quite a merited case from some very good points to think about, especially the paralleling of racism with transphobia.\\r\\n “Chappelle makes it clear that he needs Dorman to exist on his terms, not hers ”\\r\\n How can you possibly say that when you didn’t even know her? \\r\\n  “Furthermore, in repeatedly reducing Dorman’s existence to her body parts and her relationship to them and the language surrounding them, Chappelle dehumanizes her and dehumanizes other trans people.”\\r\\n Dave reduced Dorman to her body parts by talking about who she was as a person? \\r\\n “In comedy, punching down refers to humor that targets vulnerable groups of people who don’t hold much power in society. ”\\r\\n Please stop, don’t give me this pseudo-binary between those who vulnerable and those in power. When intersectionality has taught us, anything is that identity is not black and white. Are you saying a gay trans white woman who is upper middle class is more vulnerable than a cis straight white man who’s a coal miner? LGBTQ community isn’t a monolith where everyone is equally as vulnerable or marginalized. And no, that’s not oppression Olympics that is just facts. \\r\\n  “Because Chappelle seems to believe that all queer and trans people have white privilege, he views himself as punching neither up nor down and even quotes Dorman as suggesting as much.”\\r\\n No, he seems to believe his punching up as many LGBTQ don’t seem to be aware of their white privilege among their own communities.\\r\\n “This, Chappelle wants us all to know, should be the response when we’re confronted with transphobia: not anger, hurt, or pain; not a walkout in protest of Netflix, but good-humored deflection.”\\r\\n Er, did you miss the part where Dave literally mentioned the time when Dorman reacted in hurt and pain as opposed to good nature deflection? v\\r\\n Like I’m something bigger than me, like I’m the whole world in a guy. Then she said, “I don’t need you to understand me.” I said, “What?” She said, “I just need you to believe…” Just like that she goes, “…that I’m having a human experience.” And when she said it the whole crowd kind of gasped. And I gave the Fight Club look. I said, “I believe you, bitch.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Because she didn’t say anything about pronouns. She didn’t say anything about me being in trouble. She said, “Just believe I’m a person and I’m going through it.” I know I believe you, because it takes one to know one.\\r\\n “There’s even an echo of the 2005 moment in the new special, when Chappelle has to stop and gently reprimand an audience member who starts to applaud a transphobic law.”\\r\\n Gently reprimand? He flat out calls it a “MEAN LAW” you seem to be downplaying this fact because you know it would undermine your entire argument. \\r\\n “Chappelle not only justifies his comedy using white privilege, but seems to go a step further:”\\r\\n Okay, you lost all credibility when you claim that Chappelle is using white privilege with his comedy.\\r\\n “His comedy, which involves continually insisting, against science, that gender is always tied to biology, isn’t just reactionary semantics. It’s dangerous rhetoric that’s been shown in study after study can directly impact the levels of anti-trans violence and societal prejudice th',\n","  'at trans people already face daily.”\\r\\n Citation needed. You have shown no causal link between believing gender is a biological reality (at least to a certain extent) to violence against the trans community.\\r\\n Cis people: “Chapelle isn’t transphobic! Nothing he said was transphobic!!”\\r\\n Chapelle: “Look at that big chiseled jawline, that big thick Joe Rogan neck. Is that a dude? Is your daughter a man?”\\r\\n Chapelle absolutely is transphobic.\\r\\n “Chapelle: “Look at that big chiseled jawline, that big thick Joe Rogan neck. Is that a dude? Is your daughter a man?”\\r\\n Chapelle absolutely is transphobic.”\\r\\n Wow, the transcript is literally right there but you still choose to cherry pick. v\\r\\n “And then she goes, “Would you like to see her picture?” “Oh now I don’t want to see this woman’s picture, but what am I gonna do?” I’m like, “Okay sure, I’d love to see the picture.” And I grab the picture and this is all I say, this is all I say, “Oh… she is very beautiful.” And as she puts the picture away she… looks mean all of a sudden, like she caught me in some kind of trap. “What did that face mean?” And then she goes, “She’s transgender.” And I think to myself, “Oh, this bitch does know who I am.”\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I really resented that trap because that trap doesn’t let me be honest. If I was honest, I wouldn’t have fallen for it. I’d have just looked at the picture like, “Look at that big chiseled jawline, that big thick Joe Rogan neck. Is that a dude? Is your daughter a man?” Can’t say that shit. ”\\r\\n He was literally juxtaposing saying a trans daughter is beautiful to saying something offensive to very same woman. He was basically saying ” what exactly did she want me to say, would she rather I out her daughter as trans or be polite and say she’s beautiful like any person would regardless of if they are trans or not”.\\r\\n Oh, for fuck’s sake.\\r\\n At one point, the “boundaries, bitch!” part, he ACTUALLY SAYS “I’m transphobic”.\\r\\n You can take that seriously or not, that’s your prerogative.\\r\\n But, this is an act, and if you take any of this seriously, you’re missing the point.\\r\\n Almost no one cares about the fact that he calls women bitches constantly. I’ve never understood this. \\r\\n Also, can everyone here stop using the term “cisgender” as an all-encompassing opposite to “transgender”? You mention things like the fact that trans people are more likely to suffer police violence than cis people. You should not use the term “cis” here because you don’t know the gender identity of every single person who interacts with or is abused by police. Just because someone doesn’t openly identify as trans doesn’t mean they are cis. Cisgender is a dangerous word that is thrown around far too much.  Stop using it unless you know for sure.\\r\\n Dave Chappelle is right and not only is he right his not the first to make this point about LGBTQ community. To prove it let me compare Dave quote with an article I found. \\r\\n He picked up his phone and he called the police. And this, this thing I am describing is a major issue that I have with that community. Gay people are minorities, until they need to be White again.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’m being very brutally honest, so we can solve this problem. I’m telling you right now a Black gay person would have never done that to me. ‘Cause a Black gay person knows, when the police shows up they’re not going to care who called ’em. They don’t show up like, “Which one of you n*ggers is Clifford?” [laughter] We’re all Clifford. ”\\r\\n Now let’s compare Dave sentiment for this passage in an op-ed piece about white privilege within the LGBTQ from NBC news. v\\r\\n “Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our “safe spaces.” In 2017 during Philly Pride, for example, the attempt was made to add a black and brown stripe to the rainbow flag. This action was met with anger from white gay men who felt the flag represented unity despite skin color — a particularly tone-deaf defense given that Philadelphia’s gay bars had recently become a hotbed for racism.”\\r\\n Which leads me to Dave asking the audience v\\r\\n  “Is it possible, that a gay person can be racist? ”\\r\\n I think this proves that the answer is YES. v\\r\\n “It isn’t a coincidence that in that same summer of 2017, 11 owners of queer spaces in Philadelphia went through mandatory anti-discrimination training after several incidents at various gay bars — including the discovery of a YouTube video showing bar owner Darryl DePiano using racial slurs in 2016, and other alleged incidents involving racial discrimination.”\\r\\n Your email address will not be published.

What ends this?\\r\\n Like, get me out of this moment please.\\r\\n It’s a fucking nightmare.\\r\\n Cause you can’t just ask people to repeat themselves constantly.\\r\\n You can’t just be like, “What?”\\r\\n It’s annoying. You get like one “What?” per friendship.\\r\\n That’s the limit. After that, they move on.\\r\\n They’re like, “We’re gonna hang out with this dude who can hear.”\\r\\n And I don’t say that for pity, either.\\r\\n I don’t want anyone to feel bad for me ’cause I know I wouldn’t do differently if I was in their situation.\\r\\n I’m not better than anyone. I know that.\\r\\n I’ve been on the other side of that.\\r\\n My grandma’s eighty-four years old rapidly losing her hearing.\\r\\n Cannot hear shit. This is my grandma.\\r\\n Like, I love her!\\r\\n But every time I say something to her she’s like…\\r\\n My first thought is just die, already!\\r\\n Like, that’s my first thought.\\r\\n And I don’t want anything bad to happen to my grandma but I also don’t wanna have to say what I just said again.\\r\\n Like, I just said it! You had your chance.\\r\\n Somethin’s gotta give here.\\r\\n It might as well be the person who can only eat sweet potatoes.\\r\\n She had eighty-three good years. I didn’t have that.\\r\\n My point is I can empathize with my oppressors.\\r\\n It’s a weird disability. Like it’s weird.\\r\\n Like, even the things that are made to help you, people are kinda like…\\r\\n Like, they’re… about like it’s just…\\r\\n Like, I watch movies with closed captioning on which is how I watch ’em.\\r\\n I’ve always watched ’em that way. I never used to tell anyone about it I never used to bring it up because I didn’t wanna be different.\\r\\n I didn’t wanna be seen as different.\\r\\n I didn’t wanna call attention to the fact that I was different.\\r\\n The first time I brought it up I was in college.\\r\\n',\n","  ' My roommate was like “Hey, you wanna watch a movie?”\\r\\n I was like, “Yeah. Do you mind if we turn on the closed captioning?”\\r\\n “I got, like, a hearing thing” figuring he’s my friend he’d understand.\\r\\n And he said…\\r\\n And here’s the thing it’s not the same.\\r\\n If it was the same I would just ask for that.\\r\\n Second of all, I’m not even sure you’re legally allowed to say no.\\r\\n Like, this is what they’re for motherfucker.\\r\\n Turn ’em on. Like, I’m the guy.\\r\\n Like, what do you think there for? To fuck with you?\\r\\n For the people at the gym?\\r\\n Like, I’m the person that the technology is for.\\r\\n Turn them o… Like there’s a picture on the back of the box of a… Like the ear. Closed captioning.\\r\\n That’s my fucking ear!\\r\\n Turn ’em on, you psycho.\\r\\n It’s like in no other disability is this even remotely acceptable.\\r\\n It’s like, if your friend was in a wheelchair and he was like “Hey, do you mind if we take the ramp?”\\r\\n Would you be like… “Come on! The ramp?”\\r\\n “It’s all the way on the other side of the building, dude.”\\r\\n “The normal door is right here.”\\r\\n “It’s three steps. Can’t you crawl up there?”\\r\\n “Aren’t your arms stronger?”\\r\\n “Can’t we just pick you up and throw you?”\\r\\n “Is that fine? You still get there.”\\r\\n “It’s the same!” It’s not the same.\\r\\n Turn on the closed captioning man.\\r\\n I wanna see when acoustic music is playing.\\r\\n I gotta know. That’s how you know what’s goin’ on in the movies.\\r\\n You see that parentheses like, Up-tempo techno and you go, Oh! Okay.\\r\\n Now I see what’s goin’ on in this David Lynch film.\\r\\n I was … I was so lost before.\\r\\n But you didn’t look like you were about to jump in the shower.\\r\\n “Oh, that’s very nice…”\\r\\n Take it off.\\r\\n I would just think a lot, so I would just think, I would think… I would just think all day\\r\\n Just thoughts.\\r\\n It’s comfortable, because you I never would mishear myself.\\r\\n Like I never have a thought and I’m like, “Wait, one more time?”\\r\\n It’s just there. I know the thought.\\r\\n There’s a comfort to that. It gets intense, though because after a while like, the thoughts get weird.\\r\\n It’s weird up here it’s just not… A lot of weird…\\r\\n A lot of fucked up thoughts. Fucked up.\\r\\n And the thing is, you don’t know your thoughts are fucked up until you say them out loud and then that look of horror overcomes people and you’re like… Like you don’t know your thought is fucked up until you say, like, “Hey if we could eat animals why can’t we fuck them?” And people are like, “What?”\\r\\n And you’re like “Oh… I don’t know. I was just thinking about me and I feel like I… I’d rather get fucked than eaten.”\\r\\n Like I think if you told an animal, like… “Hey, we’re about to murder and then eat you”\\r\\n They’d be like … “Can you please just fuck me?”\\r\\n I would think about suicide a lot.\\r\\n Not… I didn’t wanna do it I just thought, like… If I did i',\n","  't what would a funny way be?\\r\\n Like, what would a funny way be? I don’t wanna go out boring.\\r\\n Like, what would be a funny end to all of this?\\r\\n I think it would be funny if you go to a water park and you go to the top of a really… like, a tall waterslide and, like right as you’re about to go down you just blow your head off and make the corpse go, like… through the whole course of the slide like, all the tunnels and the turns and just… just like splashes in the bottom of the pool.\\r\\n All the kids are screaming, parents are like, sprinting towards the pool.\\r\\n You know, funny!\\r\\n I think you would think that was funny even if you were there even if you were at the water park even if that was your kid in the pool.\\r\\n Once you got the kid outta the pool you dried him off you put him in the car on the ride home you’d be like…\\r\\n That’s a pretty good bit. Like, I think you would recognize the level of commitment alone is impressive like, “Oh my God! He brought a gun to a water park?”\\r\\n “He waited in line up the steps for like twenty minutes?”\\r\\n “He had goggles on, why the fuck did he have goggles on?”\\r\\n Who cares if you get water in your eyes if your… brain is exploded?\\r\\n “I’m gonna miss that guy.” You start missing me.\\r\\n You feel that kinship through the attention to detail.\\r\\n Fucked up thought.\\r\\n And that’s just a thought that I had.\\r\\n I’m not tryin’ to make light of something that people, you know ’cause it’s it… Suicide is a tough subject.\\r\\n There’s some subjects people think are just never funny.\\r\\n And I hear that I’m not like a sociopath I’m not like “Everything is funny! Fuck you!”\\r\\n No, it’s like you know I think about it I don’t wanna hurt anybody.\\r\\n But suicide’s a tough one it’s a tough one because people get offended at suicide jokes but it’s never suicidal people.\\r\\n It’s always like suicide-adjacent people.\\r\\n Like, suicidal people… Love suicide jokes.\\r\\n Right? You know why? Cause… That’s their thing.\\r\\n Like everybody has a thing.\\r\\n Like, if you’re married maybe you like a joke about marriage.\\r\\n ‘Cause you hear it, you’re like “Oh honey, that’s so us or whatever.”\\r\\n Suicidal person hears a suicide joke, it’s the same thing.\\r\\n It’s like “I’m not gonna tell anyone but that is so me!”\\r\\n You’re gonna find out in a note how good that joke really was and then regret not laughing more later because it is on the money.\\r\\n It’s cathartic.\\r\\n Like, if you’re dealing with those private, painful personal dark thoughts to hear them talked about and made light of in a public forum that’s a cathathat’s catharsis.\\r\\n You feel connected to someone outside your own mind.\\r\\n That’s a positive emotion.\\r\\n I’m not gonna take that away from someone just to spare someone else a moment of discomfort.\\r\\n But I get why people get upset.\\r\\n I had a dude once, he was like “That’s not fu',\n","  'nny.”\\r\\n “You should never joke about that.”\\r\\n “My nephew killed himself. You think that’s funny?”\\r\\n I was like “What? No.” I was like, “What? No.”\\r\\n “No, that’s not what I’m talking about at all.”\\r\\n “That’s not funny.”\\r\\n “That’s incredibly sad.”\\r\\n “I’m sad right now hearing about it, you know ’cause your nephew…”\\r\\n “Would’ve loved that joke.”\\r\\n It’s like, yeah, my target market is missing, tragic.\\r\\n Also, if he would’ve heard this joke he wouldn’t have felt alone as he obviously did and that’s really my point is if you don’t like something just let it go and hit the people that it’s meant for.\\r\\n That’s not for everybody.\\r\\n There are people who are gonna hate it. There’s people right now who are like “Dude, I fucking hate this joke and it’s gone on way too long and I just want it to end.”\\r\\n And it’s like… All right\\r\\n and now you know how suicidal people feel about life.\\r\\n We want them to stick it out a little bit longer.\\r\\n I think you can, too.\\r\\n The joke was about empathy the whole time.\\r\\n “Hey.”\\r\\n Hey.\\r\\n “I was just about to call ya.”\\r\\n I was gonna call you. How ya doin’?\\r\\n “I’m good.”\\r\\n Yeah?\\r\\n “Yeah. How was… How was your day?”\\r\\n It was good. Actually, I had a really good day.\\r\\n “Yeah? Tell me about it.”\\r\\n Well, I got up and I actually like, ran…\\r\\n Well, I did actually two hours of… I did yoga and Pilates today.\\r\\n “Both? You’re trying to…”\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n “You were tryin’ to get more of those in there.”\\r\\n No, I absolutely smashed it. I don’t even…\\r\\n Like, tomorrow I’m just gonna look ridiculously good.\\r\\n “Yeah, no, look, tomorrow you earn popcorn and whatever else.”\\r\\n Yeah, exactly, I’m gonna have… I’m gonna make a lemon square.\\r\\n “Okay. You know how to make those?”\\r\\n Yeah, I haven’t told you. I do know how to make lemon squares.\\r\\n “Is that your thing?”\\r\\n “That’s kind of…”\\r\\n Yeah\\r\\n And I know how to bake sweet potatoes as well.\\r\\n “Okay.”\\r\\n Yeah. That’s kind of it.\\r\\n “I could do one of those I’m not gonna tell you which one.”\\r\\n I bet you could bake a sweet potato but I bet you don’t know that you should put little holes in it.\\r\\n “With a fork? you punch with a fork?”\\r\\n Oh, you must. You absolutely must.\\r\\n “I know. I know a thing or two”\\r\\n And I’m not sure if you wrap your potatoes in foil because there are, like, people that wrap them and people that don’t\\r\\n “Which one are you?”\\r\\n You’ve got to wrap.\\r\\n You’ve got to wrap and poke.\\r\\n “Gotta wrap and poke.”\\r\\n Yeah, ’cause the steams gotta come out but not too much.\\r\\n I don’t know if you letif you let all your steam come out.\\r\\n Is that a plan on lemon squares too, of just the sweet potatoes?\\r\\n No, that’s a whole different thing.\\r\\n I can’t tell you that recipe.\\r\\n “That’s secret.”\\r\\n “All right, how long do I have to wait to… To find out then?”\\r\\n What? My lemon square thing?\\r\\n “Yeah.”\\r\\n I don’t know. My dead great g',\n","  'randmother told it to me so…\\r\\n “Oh, God.”\\r\\n I’m probably not gonna ever tell you.\\r\\n “That’s… I didn’t know I was stepping into an heirloom.”\\r\\n No, it’s fine. She lived a long and healthy life.\\r\\n “It’s a family crest, I was trying to pry it from you.”\\r\\n Yeah. What are you up to?\\r\\n “You know, I’m about to… About to jump in the shower and then head out. I answered un-showered.”\\r\\n But you don’t look like you’re about to jump in the shower.\\r\\n Oh, that’s very nice of you to say.\\r\\n “Take it off.”\\r\\n “You wanna come in with me?”\\r\\n No.\\r\\n “I think I would sacrifice this for this phone.”\\r\\n When was the last time you showered?\\r\\n “I’m tryin’ to give you an exact hour amount.”\\r\\n “I think eighteen hours ago?”\\r\\n Oh, eighteen hours.\\r\\n I thought you were gonna be, like two hours ago.\\r\\n Are you, like, one of those people that shower…\\r\\n Like when we see each other again, are you just gonna be…\\r\\n Like if I come in on the plane are you gonna be like\\r\\n You have to have a shower?\\r\\n I’m gonna come and…\\r\\n I always think that’s so weird. It’s like, can’t we just not do that?\\r\\n Like, I know I’ve been on a plane, but like…\\r\\n “I’m gonna have you guess shower or no shower.”\\r\\n You’re gonna make me shower though when we see each other again?\\r\\n “You should shower for sure.”\\r\\n But like if I haven’t seen you for all this time and I just get off the plane are you gonna be like…\\r\\n “You have to have a shower?”\\r\\n This is a deal breaker for me.\\r\\n “For you?”\\r\\n “Oh. If I make you shower?”\\r\\n Yes! Like straightaway.\\r\\n “No, I trust your sort of, uh, judgment on that.”\\r\\n Okay, fine, I’ll just shower before.\\r\\n “That’s up to you. I’m not gonna… I’m not gonna tell you what to do. I mean I will judge you…”\\r\\n Yeah, don’t control me. Stop it.\\r\\n “Yeah, no more… Yeah, that comes later.”\\r\\n No.\\r\\n “That comes later.”\\r\\n “I like looking at your face.”\\r\\n Shut up.\\r\\n “No?”\\r\\n “You can see your face too the little square in the bottom.”\\r\\n No, I look like a thumb.\\r\\n “That’s ’cause your thumb’s in the way.”\\r\\n It is not. I just…\\r\\n You look like… You look really dewy.\\r\\n You’re like all smooth and stuff.\\r\\n “Jews are smooth?”\\r\\n No! You’re all dewy.\\r\\n Not about you being Jew…\\r\\n You always bring it back to being Jewish. No.\\r\\n “You said I looked Jewy…”\\r\\n No, like…\\r\\n “And then you said I look smooth.”\\r\\n No, dewy like a pancake.\\r\\n “Chewy?”\\r\\n No! Dewy.\\r\\n Dewy. Like you moisturize a lot. Doesn’t matter. Whatever.\\r\\n “Is that a translation thing?”\\r\\n No, no, “Is it a language… Is it a cultural thing?”\\r\\n Dewy. Do you guys not say dewy?\\r\\n “No, Jewy means like…”\\r\\n Dewy, like smooth.\\r\\n “Jewish shit.”\\r\\n Okay, sorry.\\r\\n “I’m glad we clarified that ’cause that could be a problem.”\\r\\n No, you know, like a dewy Jew.\\r\\n “Right. Is that… Wait are we pancake or Holocaust?”\\r\\n Stop.\\r\\n You’re such an idiot.\\r\\n “Which Jewy… you gotta specify.”\\r\\n Shut up.\\r',\n","  '\\n “’cause now I’m completely lost.”\\r\\n “Is that a British thing?\\r\\n I had my eyebrows tweezed today.\\r\\n “Oh, okay! It was yoga Pilates and eyebrows.”\\r\\n Yeah. I just went in this place opposite and I felt…\\r\\n You know, like when somebody like, does something for you and you feel like all warm and gooey inside?\\r\\n Like this woman took real care about like, tweezing my eyebrows.\\r\\n And she was like showing me how to draw them in and stuff and I just, I don’t know it was really sweet.\\r\\n “Did she tweeze them or thread them?”\\r\\n No, she was tweezing them. Yeah.\\r\\n “Oh, tweezwith the tweezers? I don’t know what… I see, like, women go into places and then they come out… I just don’t really know what happens in there.”\\r\\n You know we had a lovely little moment. She was like…\\r\\n Here’s why they’re all like, wobbly and all…\\r\\n And I was like, “Yeah”. She was like “Yeah, they’re little twixers but we can… We can do something.”\\r\\n “Yeah, the threading shit is like…”\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n I do do that sometimes, but I just sneeze and cry… quite a lot.\\r\\n “It’s really hard to do”.\\r\\n Yeah, it seems insane.\\r\\n “The people who do that how do they…”\\r\\n It’s insane and I’m always really scared they’re gonna take off your eyelashes ’cause it’s literally like they get this piece of thread and just like…\\r\\n “Are they the most skilled people on the planet?”\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n “Like, they go in there quickly…”\\r\\n Oh my God. Wait, I have to tell you something.\\r\\n I went… One time I went to the Korean spa and the woman scrubbed me so hard that I bled.\\r\\n “On your… eyeyour eyebrows?”\\r\\n No, not on my…\\r\\n No, obviously not on my eyebrow.\\r\\n “She scrubbed you?”\\r\\n Scrubbed me so hard “Where were you bleeding at?”\\r\\n I got herpes a little while ago. Who gives a shit?\\r\\n That’s not a subject people are like, super open about.\\r\\n Like, I like bringin’ it up because, like, notyou know anytime I bring it up people always wanna ask questions.\\r\\n They’re like, “Oh, you got it?”\\r\\n It’s like, “Yeah.” Do you know how you got it?\\r\\n Yeah, pretty good idea.\\r\\n How’d you get it?\\r\\n I was like, I don’t know. What do you wanna know, the position?\\r\\n Like, how’d I get it? I’m not a loser.\\r\\n Like, that’s how. I’m thirty-two.\\r\\n Okay, if you’re thirty, you better either be married or have herpes.\\r\\n Like, pick one. Commit to something commit to a person or a way of life. Like, who are you?\\r\\n Three decades nothing to show for it?\\r\\n Figure it the fuck out. Marriage or herpes.\\r\\n Pick. Pick!\\r\\n A lot of my friends got married.\\r\\n I got herpes.\\r\\n At least mine is gonna last forever.\\r\\n People get fucked up about it, though.\\r\\n They get, like, fucked up about it! Like, people get fucked up!\\r\\n They hear that they have it, they get fucked up, and you shouldn’t.\\r\\n It’s not that big of a deal.\\r\\n But there’s like a sense of shame associated with it.\\r\\n ‘Cause society wil',\n","  'l imbue you with a sense of shame for something that’s on your body.\\r\\n Which is, like, that’s body shaming.\\r\\n That’s textbook body shaming.\\r\\n It’s on my body and you’re shaming me for it?\\r\\n That’s literally what body shaming is.\\r\\n No one gets behind that cause. Like, no one’s ev…\\r\\n Where’s that Dove ad campaign?\\r\\n Where’s that brave Instagram post?\\r\\n That would be brave.\\r\\n That’s a brave Instagram post. A fresh outbreak.\\r\\n Woke up like this. Like, that’s fucking brave as shit.\\r\\n That’s way braver than you with no makeup.\\r\\n I don’t know how you’re keeping score on bravery but I’m pretty sure that that wins.\\r\\n It’s not even that big of a deal.\\r\\n Right? It’s like that’s something I learned.\\r\\n It’s not as big of a deal as they make it seem so I feel like if you have it you shouldn’t let yourself get fucked up about it.\\r\\n Like don’t let it affect your sense of self.\\r\\n It’s fine.\\r\\n If you don’t have it, get it!\\r\\n Just get it!\\r\\n Then it’s over, that’s it. You’re done!\\r\\n You know what I mean? Like it’s kind of better.\\r\\n Like, I used to not have it. And now I do and it’s like… I remember I used to always worry about getting it…\\r\\n But now I don’t. That’s pretty nice.\\r\\n There’s something liberating about that.\\r\\n Like, it’s liberating to not have to worry anymore.\\r\\n Also, if we all got it, then it’s kind of like no one has it anymore which is… That’s basically a cure.\\r\\n Make it the new normal and that’s it.\\r\\n I get a lot of questions. Like a lot… People always…\\r\\n My friend, she was like “Is it hard to date now?”\\r\\n Is it hard to date now? What do you mean now?\\r\\n Like, what made you think this was easy before?\\r\\n You think herpes is some new problem?\\r\\n Like, my personality much bigger problem than herpes.\\r\\n Herpes is like number eighteen on the list of fuckin’ things in the way.\\r\\n What, do you think it’s uncomfortable?\\r\\n Oh, you think it’s an uncomfortable conversation?\\r\\n Listen, if I’m dating someone and they think that’s uncomfortable wait till I deconstruct your sense of self so I feel superior.\\r\\n That’s way more uncomfortable.\\r\\n Wait till she hears my fucked-up perspective on shit.\\r\\n Look, any girl in the world would rather hear her boyfriend say “Hey, I have HSV-two” than…\\r\\n “Hey you know, nine-eleven was just occupy Wall Street done right.”\\r\\n That’s way more uncomfortable than a very treatable STD that everyone already kind of has anyway.\\r\\n Is dating hard? I don’t know.\\r\\n Sure. Depends who you are.\\r\\n I don’t like the first date. The first date is like, I don’t like it.\\r\\n I don’t like hangin’ out with strangers.\\r\\n It’s like two hours with a stranger.\\r\\n I don’t drink either so it’s like what do you do?\\r\\n Dinner? I go to dinner.\\r\\n That’s what I do. Dinner.\\r\\n It’s too much pressure on the first date.\\r\\n Dinner?\\r\\n It’s just you and a menu and this person.\\r\\n Good luck.\\r\\n',\n","  ' Just sittin’ there in your little section.\\r\\n You gotta make small talk off the menu.\\r\\n She’s like “Oh, what should I get?” It’s like, I don’t care.\\r\\n I don’t love you.\\r\\n Chicken.\\r\\n Oh, they got glazed carrots, let’s get ’em!\\r\\n Roasted Brussels sprouts. Yeah, great.\\r\\n We’re gettin’ roasted Brussels sprouts.\\r\\n Remember when we were kids Brussels sprouts were like the worst thing and now we all, like, love ’em?\\r\\n We’re all fuckin’ sellouts.\\r\\n I don’t wanna date someone I don’t love.\\r\\n I wanna date someone I love.\\r\\n That’s the move.\\r\\n You wanna date someone you love!\\r\\n Who do I love? Not a lotta people.\\r\\n I guess where all that Freudian shit comes from ’cause it’s like yeah, your mom is the best option.\\r\\n Like on a love level… I know it’s weird and gross\\r\\n We don’t do it, but, like, wouldn’t it be awesome if we did?\\r\\n Like, imagine a universe where that was totally the deal.\\r\\n Like, that’s a better universe.\\r\\n It’s a better… Like just come out of the womb day one like, “Found her.” Like, that’s better.\\r\\n I don’t need to fuck with strangers I got the oxytocin queen right here.\\r\\n I guess that’s why the mom sits up front at the wedding cause it’s like “Well, it would’ve been you but blech so I had to go find someone I never knew. I had to turn a stranger into the love of my life.”\\r\\n On a love level though, like, who do I love more than my mom?\\r\\n Nobody.\\r\\n Who does she love more than me? Nobody.\\r\\n It is right there.\\r\\n It’s like we both love each other more than anything let’s figure this out. We can’t figure this out?\\r\\n There’s no permutation where this can fuckin’ work?\\r\\n It’s frustrating. She’s single too, not that it matters but it’s like, she’s single, I’m not saying, like, “Oh I have a chance”\\r\\n I’m like, she, my mom, is single.\\r\\n She’s, like, alone. I don’t want my mom to be alone.\\r\\n I want my… I want her to be with someone that she’s into.\\r\\n And I’m not saying, like “Oh, my mom is into me” but if we were not related she would be.\\r\\n Like, in another universe I would be her type.\\r\\n And I know it’s weird to think but to be fair I only think that because she told me that so don’t shoot the messenger.\\r\\n She’s like “Oh, you would so be my type.”\\r\\n And I’m like, “Well, what do you want me to do with that?”\\r\\n “Yeah, I wish I could. I would love to.”\\r\\n “I would love to give you me. That would make me so happy.”\\r\\n “For you to be with a guy who loves you who is so far out of your league.”\\r\\n That would be nice. And I am outta my mom’s league.\\r\\n I’m not saying that arrogantly I don’t think I’m like the best looking person.\\r\\n I just know I would never consider sleeping with a sixty-one year old woman who looked like that unless she were my mom. Like, that’s her only in. I’d have to really give a shit about how happy it made her. Like, random sixty-year-old lady, get th',\n","  'e fuck outta here!\\r\\n But my mom, it’s like…\\r\\n Well, yeah I want my mom to get fucked.\\r\\n You want your mom to get fucked.\\r\\n You just don’t wanna know when.\\r\\n But I wanna know that it’s happening for sure I just don’t wanna know when it hap… I just I don’t her to like, walk out of her bedroom, like…\\r\\n Like I don’t want that moment.\\r\\n But I wanna know that it is happening and what better way to now that something’s happening for sure than to just do it yourself.\\r\\n And that’s what I’m saying is I wish I could guarantee for her what I know she deserves.\\r\\n For her. It’s not even for me.\\r\\n I don’t win this, she wins. Right?\\r\\n Because any reasonable person would admit you would rather fuck your kid than your parent.\\r\\n That’s not controversial. That’s not controversial.\\r\\n That is… You would rather fuck your kid than your parent.\\r\\n For sure. People try to fuck their kids all the time.\\r\\n Nobody tries to fuck their parents.\\r\\n You never read that in the news like a ring of parent fuckers was broken up by the FBI in a sting operation.\\r\\n Uh, parent fucking is rampant in Hollywood and Washington and the music business and…\\r\\n Anyway, my point is I don’t think anyone gives a shit about the herpes anymore.\\r\\n “Hey”\\r\\n Hey\\r\\n Why are you still up?\\r\\n Why are you still up? It’s my bedtime.\\r\\n “Yeah.”\\r\\n You’ve been out?\\r\\n “Kind of. What…”\\r\\n You’re drunk and I’m asleep.\\r\\n “Define out.”\\r\\n I don’t know, like out.\\r\\n “I got a falafel with a friend.”\\r\\n You got a falafel?\\r\\n “Is that out?”\\r\\n Uh… It…\\r\\n Do you have, like bits of falafel in your mouth?\\r\\n I always have like have like…\\r\\n “Right now?”\\r\\n Like, I don’t really get falafel. It’s just like… like eating, like, dust.\\r\\n “It’s a little chalky, I admit that.”\\r\\n It’s so dry. I just don’t understand the falafel obsession.\\r\\n “Yeah, I don’t know if it’s an obsession as much as it is…”\\r\\n “It was open.”\\r\\n Oh, right.\\r\\n “I’m obsessed with places that are open.”\\r\\n Do you ever, like, um, order something on delivery and then you’re like you go past it in the day and you’re, like, “What the fuck?”\\r\\n Like, “I would never order from that place?”\\r\\n Or, like, “I’d never go into that place and eat.”\\r\\n “Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. ’cause it… It has the…”\\r\\n ‘Cause it’s disgusting.\\r\\n “Right.”\\r\\n “On the internet it’s only the number of stars.”\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n “And, so, they’re like, okay, four-star… star rating on restaurants is, like, the only time I trust random people in the world.”\\r\\n “Like, Oh, four and a half stars like, then it has to be good.”\\r\\n “But it’s like these are the same people who… are on trains and vote.”\\r\\n Are you one of those people who like, always has to look up the restaurant before you go and see if it’s nice?\\r\\n “I… yeah. I’m… I’m…”\\r\\n I can tell.\\r\\n “I’m a four and a half star or above.”\\r\\n Why do you look so scrumptious?\\r\\n “I look scrunched up right',\n","  ' now?”\\r\\n You look scrummy.\\r\\n “What does that mean?”\\r\\n Like if I was there right now I’d snog you.\\r\\n “Scrummy?”\\r\\n Yeah, like scrumptious.\\r\\n “Oh, I see. Is this a good thing?”\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n “Okay.”\\r\\n Yeah, like I wanna snig… Snig you no snog you. Snog and a kiss… No, what’s a snig? A snog and a kiss is a snigu.\\r\\n “All right.”\\r\\n I mean, I’m really tired.\\r\\n “These are… these are all new expressions to me.”\\r\\n No, I just… I think I’m weird jet lag.\\r\\n I also came home and my brother… has done something to the toilet.\\r\\n “What did he do?”\\r\\n He’s been staying here when I went away… I don’t know, but it’s making a weird noise.\\r\\n And when we were kids, like every time we go on holiday we just… Like my mom would have to get, um, a coat hanger and put it on the toilet because it… They’re just so long.\\r\\n “She’d have to use a coat hanger for the toilet?”\\r\\n A coat hanger, yeah, or like a piece of bamboo if we’re on holiday.\\r\\n And I know he’s done something to it, and he…\\r\\n “Where’s bamboo readily available?”\\r\\n It’s not. It’s not here.\\r\\n “Where do you have to go?”\\r\\n It’s tracking it down.\\r\\n “Yeah. How is your mom?”\\r\\n My mom?\\r\\n “Yeah.”\\r\\n She’s good.\\r\\n “Was it good seeing her?”\\r\\n Yeah. Yeah, I went round for dinner.\\r\\n They’ve just moved house.\\r\\n “Did they?”\\r\\n Yeah. My dad’s having…\\r\\n “Oh, right.”\\r\\n Like a bit of a mid-life crisis ’cause they’ve moved to a smaller house.\\r\\n “Yeah, you were saying something about that with the moving.”\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n “So he’s… He’s freaking out?”\\r\\n He’s freaking out ’cause he doesn’t have, like, what… He doesn’t, yeah. It’s a smaller house. And he thinks he’s like getting old and he’s gonna die in a small house.\\r\\n “Well, he is, I mean, I don’t know.”\\r\\n I don’t know. It’s like, I don’t know, it’s like a thing, it’s like, I don’t know, it’s like he’s giving up. But he’s buying it… I don’t know.\\r\\n They’re getting another one.\\r\\n “He’s giving up?”\\r\\n This is all. He’s just an idiot.\\r\\n Yeah. He’s not an idiot but it’s just stupid stuff to…\\r\\n “Right.”\\r\\n Worry about.\\r\\n Yeah, I think about that, like, I…\\r\\n “You know, you look at people who are, like… in the mid-life age you know, and you go like…”\\r\\n “Ah, that looks like it sucks.”\\r\\n “And you’re like, Wait, that’s next.”\\r\\n Yeah, maybe for you, not for me.\\r\\n “Well, I mean it’s next…”\\r\\n I’m a young little spring chicken.\\r\\n “Yeah, but that ends.”\\r\\n Whatever. No. I was thinking that, like…\\r\\n Am I gonna get to a certain age where no one fancies me anymore and then I was just, like, no.\\r\\n “You say no?”\\r\\n I don’t think… I don’t think it’s gonna happen.\\r\\n “That’s because you’re young.”\\r\\n No, but I think, like…\\r\\n “That’s a young thing to think.”\\r\\n No, no, but, like, even…\\r\\n No, like, I don’t know.\\r\\n I was just thinking, like I’m sure someone will be up for it when I’m, like, forty.\\r\\n “No, totally. But then…”\\r\\n “But just th',\n","  'e selection of people gets weirder.”\\r\\n No, they don’t.\\r\\n “I think it does.”\\r\\n “Right?”\\r\\n I have a hard time with intimacy.\\r\\n I have, like, intimacy issues.\\r\\n Any time I get into, like an intimate moment I feel like just… I gotta get the fuck outta there.\\r\\n “It’s just a feeling any time I see vulnerability”\\r\\n I gotta get the fuck outta there.\\r\\n And your brain is really good at justifying how you feel so if you feel like you gotta leave a situation then your brain will find reasons why you should.\\r\\n So it’ll come back with all this intel, like reasons to leave.\\r\\n And it’s hard to know if those are like legitimate red flags or just you justifying some weird insecurity.\\r\\n It’s hard to… To discern between the two “and that’s where I think therapy can be helpful.”\\r\\n Therapy kinda helps you like unmask your phobia. Like, any phobia you’re having therapy kinda gets like underneath it.\\r\\n Therapy, to me, is kinda like the last scene of Scooby Doo.\\r\\n That last sce… every episode of Scooby Doo is the same. The whole episode they’re like “Ah, it’s a ghost!”\\r\\n And they take the mask off they’re like…\\r\\n “Oh, it’s the guy who owns the bakery,” or whatever.\\r\\n That’s what I think therapy does for…\\r\\n For your emotions.\\r\\n You’re in a relationship and you’re like… I don’t know, she’s a little boring and therapy is like…\\r\\n You’re like, “Oh, my parents never showed me what love looked like.”\\r\\n “I thought she was bad at telling stories.”\\r\\n Turns out I have no foundation.\\r\\n I’m broken irreparably from the inside.\\r\\n “I’m flying blind without a map.”\\r\\n I’m replicating a power dynamic instead of reciprocity.\\r\\n Silly me.\\r\\n I thought she used the wrong form of ”you’re” in a text message.\\r\\n Turns out I downloaded my sexual identity from movies.\\r\\n You ever do that? You ever think you’re a person “and you’re actually an amalgamation of projections you’ve absorbed over thirty-two years?”\\r\\n That is brutal.\\r\\n I do think that there’s like a weird impact, that, like, movies can have.\\r\\n Maybe it just exacerbates superficialities.\\r\\n I don’t like when I get into that when I’m, like tricked by superficial shit\\r\\n Like I…\\r\\n Even when I’m not like, attracted to somebody I’m, like…\\r\\n What’s goin’ on?\\r\\n When I’m attracted to someone I’m, like, “Oh, nice face.”\\r\\n And then I’m gonna, what, overrate the ideas that come out of it?\\r\\n Right? ‘Cause, like the face and the body that’s just like, the marketing team of the self.\\r\\n And when I’m attracted to that I’m being, like, tricked.\\r\\n I feel like I’m being tricked.\\r\\n Like, I’m on the phone at four in the morning with an infomercial… Like, Hey, I saw your thing. I’d like to b… It’s…\\r\\n No! Wait till you see the thing!\\r\\n But you can’t see the thing.\\r\\n You can’t see the thing immediately.\\r\\n You have to… It’s the… You just see the face and the body.\\r\\n What’s the',\n","  ' personality like? That’s way more important.\\r\\n But that takes time, it takes patience, it takes energy it takes focus to notice.\\r\\n The face is right there.\\r\\n Maybe the personality’s fucked up.\\r\\n I think if you have a fucked up personality you should have a fucked up face.\\r\\n I don’t think you should get to have it the other way.\\r\\n Like, when I look at your face I don’t wanna see flesh.\\r\\n I wanna see, like, nine months living in a one bedroom apartment with you, like, here.\\r\\n Like that’s what… That’s what this should be.\\r\\n All this shit. Hair.\\r\\n I don’t wanna see hair.\\r\\n What is hair?\\r\\n “Oh, you have nice hair.” Who gives a shit? Hair?\\r\\n Hair is protein that arbitrarily grows out of your head against your will.\\r\\n And you have nice that? Awesome.\\r\\n It’s an aesthetic thing.\\r\\n If something is gonna grow out of your head I don’t wanna see hair I wanna see like, long flowing locks of your ability to keep a secret.\\r\\n That’s what should come outta your head.\\r\\n That way someone flips it back “Oh, I can trust that person.”\\r\\n And we can continue not trusting bald people like we normally do except we wouldn’t be superficial shitheads for it, we’d be right.\\r\\n Yeah, I can’t trust that dude.\\r\\n He has… He doesn’t have the secret-keeping substance coming out of his skull.\\r\\n Fuck that bald asshole! And you’d be right!\\r\\n That would be a legitimate thing to say as opposed to a low-key hate crime like it is now.\\r\\n You can’t call someone a bald asshole.\\r\\n I didn’t pick that.\\r\\n There’s all sorts of things I can do to become more attractive, too.\\r\\n I can, like, make myself more attractive.\\r\\n I can work out, I can get in shape.\\r\\n That would make me more attractive.\\r\\n I can get abs, people would be more attracted to me which is weird because all abs mean is I did this a lot.\\r\\n Like, that’s literally all it means is I tricked my body into thinking it was building a house.\\r\\n Like, that’s what abs are it’s an exploitation of an evolutionary glitch.\\r\\n People go, “Oh, he did this a lot.”\\r\\n He’ll make a great date.\\r\\n Like, how? How does that track?\\r\\n You should only be able to get abs by doing something good.\\r\\n Like, you should have to… In order to get a…\\r\\n You should have to like help the elderly, that would make sense.\\r\\n Like, you help an old lady cross the street and get ripped\\r\\n Like, okay, yeah, sure, I buy that.\\r\\n That way you see a guy on the beach with washboard abs you can be like “Oh, well he loves his grandma”\\r\\n Like, you would know something about him other than he did this a lot after work four times a week.\\r\\n He did the side-to-side one probably.\\r\\n Look at that.\\r\\n He probably used a medicine ball.\\r\\n What a cool guy! It’s fucking stupid.\\r\\n But we are attracted to these things.\\r\\n We’re attracted to, you know, what we’re attracted to and as a society when we are all attracted',\n","  ' to certain things we create this, like external value system and when you live inside of that you internalize that as your own.\\r\\n So, you feel a sense of internal pride or shame based on how closely you correlate to that… That value system.\\r\\n So, people get fucked up about how they look that’s well documented. People also get…\\r\\n It’s weird like, people take pride like, there’s a weird pride people take in how they loo Like, there’s men who take, like pri…\\r\\n They have, like, dick pride like pride in their di… Like…\\r\\n My fuckin’ dick! Like, they talk about their dick like it’s a son that graduated from Harvard.\\r\\n Like, where’s the pride…\\r\\n My fuckin’ dick!\\r\\n Oh, my biit’s not even my dick. I’m its body.\\r\\n Like what are you talk… Like…\\r\\n My fuckin’ dick.\\r\\n My big-ass di… It’s like, “So?”\\r\\n How’d you get it?\\r\\n It’s like, “Dude it just showed up!”\\r\\n Your dick should only be as big as your heart.\\r\\n And it should only be as girthy as your capacity for change.\\r\\n That way you see a fat dick you go…\\r\\n “Oh, that’s a spiritually open malleable human being.”\\r\\n You sit on a fat dick I can feel his open mindedness stretching me out.\\r\\n That desire he has to transcend his past mistakes.\\r\\n It feels good.\\r\\n It makes me feel full.\\r\\n I’m attracted to things I’m attracted to… Eyes. I like eyes.\\r\\n I’m attracted to eyes. Not, like, in a bag but, like, on a head. Eyes. I like my eyes on heads.\\r\\n Two eyes for every one head. That’s the ratio that I like.\\r\\n You can have whatever ratio you want.\\r\\n I like eyes. But even that’s weird.\\r\\n I like the eye, but then it’s like…\\r\\n “Oh, now I wanna like, fuck you. Why?”\\r\\n “‘Cause you have nice eyes?” That’s a weird leap to make.\\r\\n To go, like “Oh, yeah, these eyes are cool.”\\r\\n “Let’s fuck the other…” This other part of you.\\r\\n It’s not even the same… It’s not even on the same part of the body.\\r\\n It’s a different part.\\r\\n The vagina.

I have a hard time with people, so here we go.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Well, it’s always been hard for me to connect with people throughout my whole life, and I think there’s, you know, a lot of reasons for that. Um, I have a hearing loss that I’ve had since I was a kid. When I was three years old… I failed a hearing test. I took a hearing test and the doctor said, “You failed the hearing test.” Well, I didn’t know what he said, but…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n …he said something, and my parents got upset, so I assumed I didn’t nail it, and… So he told my parents, he said, “This kid needs hearing aids.” And so instead of doing that, they didn’t. So we just…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n …coasted until I was 21. I didn’t wear them till I was 21. I wore them for like a week when I was in fifth grade, but then this girl I had a crush on asked about them. She’s like, “What’s in your ear?” I was like, “Well, that’s the end of that forever.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “So I’ll figure… I’ll figure it out.” It instilled this kinda sense of shame in me. You know, I took it as something was wrong with me. I put it on myself. I go, “I must be fucked up.” And then I’m like, “No, my doctor fucked up.” And then my friends were like, “No, dude, your parents, your parents fucked up.” And it’s like, “Oh, cool, well, add it to their tab.”\\r\\n Like, I don’t know…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n They got a long tab running, you know. Also, they got divorced when I was 12, which is, like, the most “fuck you” age you could possibly…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Like, you guys weren’t, like, killing it when I was five. You couldn’t have done it then? You had to wait until I was 12? They did do the thing where they… This is a common thing I think parents do when they get divorced, they tell their kids… They told me, “It’s not your fault. Don’t worry, it’s not your fault.” It’s like, “Yeah, first of all, I wasn’t thinking that. Uh… I don’t know why you thought I thought it was on me. Have you seen you guys? Mom is cripplingly insecure, and Dad’s addicted to prostitutes. On what fucking world is this on me?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n I didn’t have a good blueprint… for what a relationship should look like, so, you know, I’ve struggled accordingly. I’ve had issues in relationships. There’s other reasons for that, too. Like it can’t be a good thing… (CHUCKLES) It can’t be a good thing that the first… 2,000… sexual experiences of my life…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n …were with a Dell computer. Like that can’t be…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n It can’t be helping. It can’t be pushing me in the right direction on this pursuit of love and happiness that I’m on. Two thousand. That’s the number, by the way. I didn’t, like, write down a funny number for you. I counted.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s literally 2,000, age 12 to 19 was exclusively that every single day. I bought a computer for my family with my bar mitzvah money, and then I fucked it for seven years straight.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n That’s how I began. That is the origin story to my sexual identity, just downloading sexist shit into my head. Then waltzing out into the world like, “Oh, yeah, I totally respect people.” How? How is that even possible? It’s so corrosive. That shit will rot your brain. And it’s certainly, for a young boy, like, it’s insane. Even now, it’s like… We like to pretend lik',\n","  'e it’s fine, but that’s only because we don’t have to acknowledge what it is that we’re doing. It’s like this virtual, wordless escapade. You never have to be accountable for what it is you’re doing. I think before… you’re allowed to click on a video… you should have to say the title out loud.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n How badly do you want this? I feel like most people are like, “I’m just gonna call my mom and reconnect… the person I need to be.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n And it’s bled in. Yeah, my relationship dynamics have always been somewhat turbulent. A lot of back and forth, break up, get back together kind of things. A lot of things that start really quickly. It’s like immediate intensity, you know? Because usually I feel like shit about myself and they feel like shit about themselves, and we come together and we’re like, “Well, we have each other. And we can do all this stuff! We can do all this stuff together now that we’re both here. We can rub each other’s heads. We can take naps together. We can, like, slow dance in the kitchen while we’re waiting for our cookies to finish baking.” How specific do you want me to get?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n But then when I have all that stuff, I’m able to see, I’m like, “Oh, this is a very codependent relationship, this isn’t healthy. This isn’t the kind of thing I wanna be in long term. You’re not the person that’s right for me.” So I’ll be like, “Maybe we should break up.” But then they leave, they take all the stuff! I’m like, “I wanna break up with you, but you should love me still. Like, you should still give me all the things, just don’t ask me for anything.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Like, “I need you. Like, this is all built off of the back of you. Like, your love for me gave me the confidence to even feel like I could break up with you.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “I never would’ve broken up with you if I was by myself.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n But it’s a self-esteem thing. I don’t feel… I don’t feel, like, good enough for the person that I… that would be right for me, you know? So, what if… I play this in my head. What it feels like I need to do is I need to find a girlfriend, uh, in order to be confident enough to be the type of person that I would need to be in order to attract the girl that I actually want to be with.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n On my own, I’m nothing, but in a relationship, I’m kind of a catch.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES) I feel like this is a common phenomenon, that love at first sight, that idea, it gets propagated. We all know what you mean by it, “love at first sight.” And it’s something that’s a really enchanting idea, you know? ‘Cause you’re like, you know, one minute you’re alone, the next minute you’ve found the one. It’s like, “What a… What a day.” (CHUCKLES)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n What a day that would be. And so it’s so enticing, but I’ve seen… I’ve gone that route so many times, I know what’s on the back end of it, so it’s hard for me not to be cynical about it. Now when I hear people like, “We knew right away…” Did you? ‘Cause now anytime I hear someone say about their own relationship, “We knew right away,” all I hear is, “We were both abandoned as children.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n You knew right away? Your threshold for loving a person is you saw them once? That seems like a low bar to clear.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n I feel like maybe you can’t handle the anxiety of uncertainty, so you went from ',\n","  'zero to 100 right away to skip over that prospect of rejection and the risk that they might not be who you imagine them to be. Am I close? Am I fucking close? -Like, I feel like that…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n …is a more accurate characterization of what we’re talking about. If you’re drawn to somebody that quickly, that strongly, that intensely, that immediately, that’s not love. You probably have unresolved trauma.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n And the other person probably represents an embodiment of the trigger of that trauma, so you’re drawn to them in this misguided attempt to retroactively fix a fucked-up period in your past. That’s not love! Don’t call that love. Don’t rebrand that as love and make the rest of us feel bad. Don’t be out in the world like, “It was love at first sight.” Say something honest like, “It was ‘I felt the way I did when my dad left’ at first sight.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n I’ll believe that. I’ll believe that, yeah. “My husband’s face looks just like the back of my father’s head, so I chased it…”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “…to now.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n You should not be chasing. Don’t chase. Love should not be chased. (GASPS) You shouldn’t have that, like, “Are we gonna make it?” (CHUCKLES) No!\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n If you’re wondering, no. You should not be chasing. Like in movies, like, to propagate this idea, “chase them,” and that rom-com fantasy of chasing someone to an airport. Chase a therapist to an airport. Like, don’t… Like, “Don’t leave, we have so much work to do!”\\r\\n Like, that’s…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES) No, ’cause movies have to show you… They can’t show you what love actually is. We don’t wanna see it. Love isn’t entertaining. They have to show some dramatic, conflicted version of love. They don’t… We don’t wanna see love, actual love. It’s beautiful. I’m not shitting on the sentiment. It’s an amazing thing between the two people. It’s not fun to watch. Think about a couple you know, maybe you are that couple, who are truly in love, in love, like, together, good, healthy. We don’t wanna watch that. Like, if you wanna…\\r\\n If you…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n If you watched a movie about a couple in love, you would just be on your couch watching a couple on their couch, watching a better movie.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n You’re like, “Why… What are they watching? I’ll just watch that. Why don’t we cut out… cut out the middleman? I don’t need…”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, my God. That’s not what they show you. ‘Cause we don’t wanna see… We don’t wanna see healthy, good love. We wanna see, like, a manifestation of, like, our own internal dramas played out… for entertainment value. The problem is there are people out there, like when I was a kid, who are like empty canvases, who internalized that. And so it starts to skew their view of what love could be. Like, people who don’t have a healthy blueprint are gonna absorb that and take that in. You know, I was 12 years old when the movie Titanic came out, and that was, like, iconic love story. Like, here it is, epic love, cruelly interrupted by fate. And I look at that movie now, I’m like, “Wait, what were we rooting for here? What did we want to happen? For them to get to New York? They weren’t gonna make it as a couple.” What did we think? They’re 20 years old, they’ve known each other two days. I don’t know everything about relationships, but like, hey, maybe don’t ',\n","  'marry the artist you fucked on a cruise.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n Maybe that’s not the move. Five minutes after you tried to kill yourself. Do you remember that’s how they met? She was trying to kill herself by jumping off the boat, and he was like, “Hey, I’m pretty hot. What if you didn’t do that?” And so…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n That’s how they started. They knew right away. Like, that’s the thing, is like, what happens? How is that gonna play out? Even if they get to New York, what? -They have nothing in common.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n You know what I mean? Like, all they have is the excitement that they made it. That lasts, what? Six months, a year… two years, maybe? What happens five, ten years down the road? Just sittin’ there. He’s like, “So… you want me to draw you?” She’s like, “Fuck you!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “I was engaged to a billionaire. I had to sell that necklace to pay the heating bill. You haven’t sold a sketch in years, Jack. How’s that art gallery going, Jack?” He’s like, “Oh, come on. Remember when we danced -with the common folk?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Terrible. It would’ve been terrible. People are like, “Oh, it’s so sad what happened. If they didn’t hit the iceberg…” Fuck that! The iceberg is the hero of that movie. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It might’ve killed Jack, but it saved the rest of Rose’s life.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n I like movies, I do. I do. I don’t like movie culture, though, like Hollywood… like the culture surrounding it. And every time I get roped into watching an award show, I’m always reminded, like, who the fuck makes these things. It’s like, “Oh, my God.” You ever watch an award show? It’s like this shouldn’t be on television. This should be, like… like, in an underground cave at Bohemian Grove. Like, why is this in front of the public? ‘Cause they try to act like they’re down-to-earth. Every time an actor wins an award, they always give some… It’s not some, like, normal speech, it’s like a lofty, sociopolitical response to the moment. It’s like, “We need to find a way. There’s a lot of problems in the world. We need to find a way to come together and not let it divide us.” Like Meryl Streep, “We need to come together.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Find unity and strength, and break down the barriers that keep us apart. -And find strength and unity.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Come together as a globe, as a nation, as a people.” I’m always like, “Yeah, uh, you’re wearing a diamond dress from Givenchy.” Like, on what fucking planet are you part of “the people”?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Like, what do you think? Like, if there was a true people’s revolution, like a people’s uprising, it’s gonna be your blood -splattered on the sidewalk.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n They’re not gonna spare you ’cause they liked Devil Wears Prada. They’re gonna rip your fucking head off, stick it on a stake, and sell that diamond dress to a cartel for machine guns.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n They’re not gonna be like, “Oh, get in the bunker. We love the nuance of your artistic choices. It was so brave of you, how you dared, oh, how you dared to be a middle-class character.” Like, “Oh, how you pretended to be a thing people are their entire lives. How did you do it? How did you prepare for the role?” And they’re always like, “Oh, I lived amongst plumbers -for eight months.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “I lived how they lived. I ate how they ate.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n ',\n","  'No, that’s it, you can’t. You can’t preach togetherness and unity when you’re that rich. You just can’t do it. You’re rich. You’re super rich. That’s why you got rich, is to get the fuck away from everybody.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n That’s what money is. Money is just an escape from people. That’s why we want it. Everything money does for you. Doesn’t even have to be a lot of money. You’d be like, “Ooh, I can afford an Uber.” What’s an Uber? That is a bus for one person.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n It’s like, “Yeah, I like the bus. I just wish there were no people on it and it only went where I want it to go.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Yeah, you can do that. You gotta pay for it. You wanna join a gym, there’s different kinds of gyms, right? There’s a whole spectrum of gym options. There’s a ten-dollar-a-month gym on one end. Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym on the other end. What’s the difference? Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym, it’s nicer. It’s not 20 times nicer. It’s not like the ten-dollar-a-month gym, the walls are falling off, and you pick up the ten-pound weight and it’s 100 pounds. You’re like, “Oh, fuck this gym! The dumbbells are Gatorade bottles filled with rocks, this gym sucks.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n No, there’s still equipment there. The 200-dollar-a-month gym, you pay 200 dollars a month so you don’t have to look at people who can only afford ten dollars a month.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n That’s what you’re paying for. You wanna be able to do a pull-up without being reminded of the dark underbelly of capitalism.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s a 190-dollar surcharge to not have to make eye contact with the consolation prize in this fucked-up game we’re all playing here. That’s what you’re paying for. That’s the premium. Everything money does for you just pushes you further and further away from everybody else. You wanna fly, you buy a plane ticket. First-class ticket, way more expensive. Why? There’s less people up there. They won’t tell you that. They’ll be like, “No, you get more space.” It’s like, yeah, motherfucker, space is just the absence of people.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n It’s not a new entity. Space is a euphemism for not anybody. “No, you get all this legroom.” Yeah, ’cause they’re no people in the way of where my legs are trying to go. We could all have legroom back here if we weren’t all back here.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Now, could you imagine if two people in economy class were, like, fighting over the armrest, and some asshole from first class came back and was like, “Hey! We need to all work together. We need to find unity and strength as a flight. We’re all flight 348, after all.” Then they swoosh the curtain and go back to their apartment in the sky. How quickly before the back rows start bundling their plastic silverware together to storm the front?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Like, “No, no, we’re not trying to hijack the plane, we’re just trying to kill rows one through five. Take their hot towels and orange juice and spread it around.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n That’s the fantasy. Everyone fantasizes about what they would do when they get rich. You wanna get away from everybody. Nobody fantasizes about togetherness. Nobody’s like, “Oh, dude, if I got rich… (CHUCKLES) I would get so many roommates.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Oh, it’d be sick, we’d have like a dishes schedule.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n No, the fantasy is, “I’m gonna build a moat around my hou',\n","  'se. People aren’t gonna be able to ring my doorbell without swimming across a crocodile-laden river.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Fuck everybody. And I got nothing against rich people. You just can’t have it both ways. You can’t bridge class with a speech. You can’t have it all and then have this, like, faux empathy. Like, “Aww… it’s so sad, people don’t have any money.” It’s like, “Well, you seem to have it.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Try giving it away. You don’t have to have it.” And these phony causes, every Thanksgiving, one of them comes out with, like, “It’s so terrible what happened to the Native Americans.” It’s like, “Fucking, I don’t know, give ’em the land back.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) “No.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “We can’t do that. Where would we put the offices of DoorDash?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES) I swear to God, these fucking… Like North America could be, like, falling into the ocean. We could all be killing each other over grain seeds and fresh water. These people would be like on Mars, -tweeting, “Stop the violence.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Love is stronger than hate.” And changing their profile picture to a blue circle to show they still care about Earth.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Going on Jimmy Fallon to promote it, like, “Yeah, we’re changing our profile pictures to blue circles to raise Earth awareness.” Jimmy’s just like, “Oh, my God, it’s genius. Such a good idea.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Oh, my God, how’d you think of it? It’s so important. You’re doing such important work.” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Oh, my God, it’s…” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)\\r\\n (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Jimmy Fallon. I’m sorry, is there a more Guy Smiley, useless, puppet fuck of a person…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)\\r\\n …than Jimmy Fallon? Professional napkin. Like how the fuck?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n (GIGGLES SARCASTICALLY) Dude, I used to think Leno said nothing. Fallon makes Leno look like Malcolm X.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Like, “Oh, yeah.” (BABBLES INCOMPREHENSIBLY) I’ll never get asked to do the show, but…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES) I… I would wanna do it just one time, just to be like, “Hey, Jimmy, what do you not like?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “What… Is there anything… Do you have a hard stance on fucking anything?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n He’d be like, “Oh, my God, it’s such a cool take.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n (GIGGLES) “I don’t know, I… I just kinda float around. I have no discretion, yet I’m hugely influential. Culture’s a joke.” (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Every time I speak, I mean less to myself. I’m murdering my identity up here.” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) “It’s genius.” (LAUGHS) Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Like you could literally… You could put a gun in his mouth and… (MIMICS GUNSHOT) …blow his head off and he’d be like, “Oh, my God, my brains are on the wall! It’s so cool!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “How’d you do that?” He’s a horror movie villain. You can’t kill him. His weapon is just effusive nothingness. He just keeps coming. (SCREECHES) “Come back! Don’t you wanna play truth or dare with Ariana Grande?” (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n Nice. (SIGHS) Look, I just think if entertainment is gonna be this ubiquitous, it can’t be this devoid of humanity. It just can’t. It… You know, ’cause I grew up, entertainmen',\n","  't was important to me. And so, you know, I looked to it for something, and to be that devoid of substance, it feels… insulting. The problem with entertainment is that it’s all made… by the same type of person. It’s made by entertainers. Right? So it’s like…\\r\\n Entertainers are psychotic.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Like, just statistically. So, look at this room right now. Almost everybody in the room is sitting nicely, looking at this, and only one person is like, “Heh, heh, my thoughts.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “My thoughts.” And after this is over, you’ll go home to your respectable lives. And I’ll try to find another place to do, “My thoughts.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Soon I’ll be full.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n So you have to consider the source, right? I think about that with all media. Social media, for example, like, you know… You look at like Twitter or something like that, it’s like… Like Twitter… Who’s on Twitter? It’s just… It’s only people who think it’s like a good idea -to be on Twitter. Like…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s not everybody. It pretends to be everybody, like, “Ooh, everyone’s mad.” You look at the trending topics, “Ooh, what’s everyone talking about?” It’s not. Most people aren’t on it. Eighty percent of the public doesn’t use it. Ninety percent, I think, doesn’t use it regularly. So, like, what’s trending? Like… Most people aren’t there, so what’s really trending is shutting the fuck up. Like, most people…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Most people are doing that, but you can’t register that. You can’t show somebody not tweeting. Like you can’t… They should show how much we don’t tweet also. They should show like a tweet, and then you scroll through blank space for like seven hours.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n And then you come across another tweet. You’d be like, “This is a barren wasteland for lunatics.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Everyone on Twitter is somebody on Twitter. There’s an inherent insanity in the medium. Right? It’s the same reason I can’t trust Yelp.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Every time I look at Yelp, I read a Yelp review, I’m like, “Yeah, but this person wrote a Yelp review.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Why am I listening to a person who logged in to write three paragraphs on broccoli rabe?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Everyone on Yelp is someone on Yel… Every Yelp review starts with someone going, “I’m gonna write a Yelp review.” Like, fuck whoever that person is. But that’s everyone on Yelp. Everyone on Yelp is someone who uses Yelp. Everyone on Twitter is someone who uses Twitter. I want a social media site where the only way to use it is to not. Like, I don’t wanna hear the thoughts that you want me to think that you think. I wanna hear what you think. I wanna hear what you don’t even let yourself think you think. You know those thoughts? You ever have like a fucking crazy thought that bubbles up, and you push it away, you’re like, “Didn’t think it! Didn’t think it. Still a good person. Didn’t… ‘Cause I didn’t think it all the way. I didn’t finish the thought that I clearly started, so somehow that’s not me.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n I want those. I want you to cut open your heart and dump it into my brain. Intimacy is what I’m looking for. Which is not… I shouldn’t go to social media for intimacy, you can’t get it. You ever see someone try to be intimate on social media? -It’s fucking terrible.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It doesn’t work. It never works, ’cause ',\n","  'it doesn’t have the language for intimacy. ‘Cause intimacy is amorphous. It doesn’t come with a character limit, or a soundtrack, or filter, it’s just… (GRUNTS) The language of social media, is like, snark and division and attacks and clapbacks and, “Oh, that? Oh, clearly you don’t even know about this.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n That rises. That gets a lot of attention. But we’re all, like, fucked up, right? It’s like very confusing, and there’s a big market right now for certainty. Anyone who has an answer, even if it’s the wrong one, is in demand. That’s why you get this whole rash of people who garner these followings, ’cause they’re giving people a narrative. All these like, you know, podcast hosts, demagogue type, usually a white dude who’s like, “Hey, the media and the government are all lying to you, but you know who’s not?” (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) “Me!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Me, the guy trying to sell you CBD oil and sex toys every 30 minutes. I’m your beacon of truth. Wear me, listen to me.” This is collective narcissism. It’s changed the way we think, like the way we process our own language, like how we sound. I remember in the ’16 election, they were talking about the Rock maybe running for president, and I said that to a friend, I was like, “Yo, I heard the Rock might run for president.” My buddy was like, “Is the Rock a Democrat?” And I was like, “Dude, listen to the sentence…”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “…that you just said. Is the Rock a Democrat? I don’t know. He’s a fake wrestling character. I don’t know where he stands on healthcare.” Is the Rock a Democrat? I don’t know. Did the Yellow Power Ranger support the war in Iraq? What the fuck are we talking about?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n Where does Mickey Mouse stand on abortion? I don’t know. Is he a “second trimester or before” kind of mouse, or more like a hardline… (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) “Life begins at conception, folks.” Like, I don’t know what Mickey thinks. Does Mickey think, or does he just do whatever the artist makes him do? Is there a consciousness in Mickey? Do any of us think, or are we just being guided by an unseen hand? Is thinking part of the illusion? Is Descartes a fraud? This is why I had to get off of Twitter. I existentially spiral. I lose who I am. I did, I deleted my Twitter a year ago. I still have Instagram because I’m stupid.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Instagram is… It’s like hell. It’s just like hell. You can download hell to your phone for free.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n It’s free. Hell is free. Instagram is just like, “Hey… uh, are you not feeling jealous today?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Come hang out. Look, there’s a beer, some food you’ll never eat. Go fuck yourself. We hate you. We are trying to tear you down. We don’t give a fuck. Here’s places you’ll never go. Here’s a person that will never fuck you. Go fuck yourself. We hate you.” “We are manipulating your emotions, and then monitoring them so we can sell you shit. You want a bracelet? Yeah, we knew you would, motherfucker.” Literally. Literally! Literally. People are like, “What do those bracelets mean?” They mean I’m a fucking moron!\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n They mean I was depressed and got a targeted ad and thought these bracelets would turn it all around.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n That’s what they mean. “You are nothing. We have hollowed you out and emptied you and filled you with ourselves and the desire for more. You are powerle',\n","  'ss against it. This is a takeover. Didn’t happen the way it did in Terminator. It’s a lot more subtle, with more cat videos and 14-year-olds twerking. Is that a crime? Ha, ha. We’ll never tell you.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n I hate it. It makes me feel like shit. The only social media site that I like… is, uh, Venmo.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n That’s right. I like Venmo. Venmo’s a money transfer app, which everybody knows. But what not everybody knows is that on Venmo, there’s a feed, where you can like… tab over and you can see all of your friends’ and your contacts’ financial transactions, which should be illegal, but it’s there.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n It’s right there. And I like it because it’s honest. It’s the only honest social media site out there. Every other social media site is a projection of a version of yourself that you wish you were onto a canvas. Not Venmo. Venmo is the honest antidote to the horseshit of Instagram. Instagram makes you feel bad because you’re aware of your own fears and insecurities and preoccupations, but you’re not seeing anybody else’s. So you’re always gonna lean that way. So you see a picture on Instagram of, like, a couple…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Maybe they’re on, like, a beach… looking at a gorgeous sunset. Maybe they’re eating a pizza.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n You look at this, you’re like, “What the fuck? What the fuck? The fuck is wrong with me? How come I’m not doing that shit, huh? Is there something wrong with me? Is there a hole here that everybody can see? Do I emanate darkness, do I repel love? Is there a limit to my emotional aptitude? Did my father’s genetics set that limit? Do I need to go back on antidepressants? What the fuck is going on inside of me that’s not leading me to that type of bliss? What do I have to do to get there?” But then you look at Venmo and it’s like, “Oh, no, dude, they split that pizza.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHEERING)\\r\\n (APPLAUSE)\\r\\n “I’m doing just fine.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “I don’t need medication.” (CHUCKLES) It’s not a referendum on splitting stuff in a relationship. I think if you’re gonna split stuff, just don’t split the items. Go every other. Does that make sense? I’ll see that on Venmo. I go on Venmo, I’ll see, “Boyfriend sends girlfriend money for tacos.” I’m just, like, how the fuck do you go down on someone after you just sent them eight bucks?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n (SCOFFS) “You’re just bitter, Drew, that you have no one to split stuff with.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Yeah, I’m single. I’m 36… and single. I’m single and 36, which is fine. Uh, but it is almost not.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Like, it’s not bad yet, but bad is next.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Bad is the next stop on this… train. A lot of my friends are married. And it’s cool to see. A lot of them are in, like, really great relationships, really healthy, good, loving relationships. And it’s really amazing to see. I go to their weddings, I really enjoy it. Seeing them come together, it’s a beautiful thing. And I hear a lot of the same things in the vows. There’s a common refrain in the vows, which is something about, like, you know, “I get to marry my best friend.” “I’m so lucky to have found my best friend.” “I never thought I would spend the rest of my life with my best friend.” And I hear that, I’m like, “That’s such a beautiful sentiment.” Like, the person you marry should feel… like your best friend. I’m in the back, I’m like, “Well,',\n","  ' I’m 36, so who the fuck meets their best friend in their late thirties?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Who’s out there like, “This is my best friend! We met when were 38!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Tell him, Doug!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n No, it doesn’t happen. They’re all having kids, too, starting families. My friends starting families, it’s beautiful to see. I don’t have my own family. I have, like, a family from which I’ve come. I don’t have…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n …the next line on that. Like on a family tree, I’m just a node that ends.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s just like, “Who’s that?” “That’s your great Uncle Drew, nobody loved him.” (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Just a leaf on a twig. Just a Styrofoam ball with no toothpicks, if we’re using school project lingo.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Oh, cool, you got me a PlayStation for my birthday. I love you, Dad.” I just beat God of War for the fourth time.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE MEMBER CHEERING)\\r\\n It’s a good game.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s not “hugging my smiling child” good.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGH)\\r\\n But the gameplay mechanics are pretty tight.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n I think part of the reason I don’t… have a family, well, at least what I used to tell myself, is that I do this. It’s something that I chose. I chose a different path. I remember I started doing stand-up when I was 22. I dropped out of school, and… at the time, my mother warned me. She said, “You know, it’s not very stable. You’re gonna be living hand-to-mouth, traveling a lot. You’re not gonna be able to settle down.” And she was right to an extent. But the problem was, she was telling this to a 22-year-old dude. Like the least likely candidate on Earth to settle down. I don’t know if you know any 22-year-old dudes, but they’re not technically people.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Just unprocessed pain and skin. Like, that’s pretty much the identity there. So, 22, I’m hearing this, I’m like, “Settle down? What are you, a hundred? I don’t give a fuck. I’m going on the road, Mom. I’ma follow my dreams! Nobody is gonna stop me!” That was my attitude. Now I’m 36. Now I see the punchline. Now it’s like… (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) “Nobody is going to hug me as I die.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) Is that funny? I don’t know. I structured it as a joke. Does that make it funny? I don’t know. Does comedy have the ability to transform the emotional constitution of reality, or is it just adding a layer to an unfortunate event? I don’t know how the physics of comedy work. I used to tell myself that it was a sacrifice I was making. I was leaving that on the side to pursue this. And I used to look… It was very easy to make that argument, ’cause I used to look around and there were a lot of men who accomplished things that I considered to be great, whose personal life was kind of left by the wayside. And so it seemed to me as a necessary component. I remember in high school I learned about Isaac Newton. And Isaac Newton invented calculus. He also died a virgin.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Which begs the question, can you invent calculus while fucking people?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n I don’t know. It’s never been done.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n A more modern example, Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs was an incredible innovator… uh, terrible father… right, which we know, it’s documented, but we also just knew.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n We knew. Every time we’d go into our pocket, if Steve Jobs were a',\n","  ' good dad, we’d pull out a Samsung or a Motorola.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Every time you text someone and it shows up blue, that’s Steve Jobs not going to a piano recital -or a softball game.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n And I don’t think we have the right to judge him. Like, we are all glad he did it. Like, we encouraged that. As a society, we would all rather one girl grow up with a shitty dad than have to all of us use Windows. Are you out of your fucking mind? You want us all to click a Start button and run clunky .exe files just so one girl can open her gifts next to the guy who paid for them? Fuck that! She can get them from a nanny while the rest of us enjoy our… technological ecosystem seamlessly integrated.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n That’s what we encourage. We encourage it. True happiness has no societal value. We want productivity. Give us… Make something or shut up! Like, we don’t care. So there’s this incentive to do it. And it gets even more fucked up. Someone like Michael Jackson, who was this incredible popstar and a horrendous babysitter, you know, where it’s just like…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Yeah, it’s an easy one, but it’s fun. It’s fun, though. It’s so easy, but it’s so fun.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n No, but even that, like there’s such an instinct to defend these guys. Like my first instinct is to be like… see it from their side, because I think we’re such… we’re conditioned to like them on that level. So even with Michael, I was like… you know, there was a part of me… I watched that documentary about him, I was like, “Oh, that’s fucked up.” But there was a part of me that was like, “Yeah, but if not an eight-year-old boy, who was Michael Jackson supposed to date?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n You know what I mean? What is he looking at, options-wise, that makes any sense at all? Somebody his age? He did that. He was married to Lisa Marie Presley, a grown woman, and that was weirder somehow.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n That was weirder. They made out on television. It was fucking weird. There was like an awards show presentation and at the end, they like did this kiss, it was just awful. Like, “Oh!” The whole world was just like, “Oh, my God.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Jesus, will somebody get this guy a kid?” -Like, “This is horrible.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n Because Michael Jackson with a kid, it upsets us morally, but it looks right.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Michael can’t date an adult. You wouldn’t set your friend up with him. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Who’s he supposed to… What is he gonna do, go on like a blind date with a 35-year-old software developer? How’s that gonna go? “Hey, nice to meet you, Michael.” He’s like, “You wanna play tag? You’re it.” Like, come on.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “Where are your…” “Tag? I thought we’d go to dinner.” “Dinner’s for dumb-dumbs. We can eat candy at my house and stay up as late as we want. Tee-hee!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Michael can’t date an adult. I don’t even know what kind of adult would be into Michael. Like you wanna… you wanna fuck him? Listen to him sure, but, like, you wanna…\\r\\n (IMITATES MICHAEL JACKSON) You wanna fuck that guy?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n You wanna fuck him? “Here, doo-doo head.” You’re gonna fuck him? Dude, if you’re an adult and you wanna fuck Michael Jackson… you’re a pedophile.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n But you look at all these guys, you know, Michael Jackson, Isaac Newton, Steve Jobs, they were ador',\n","  'ed by the world but hated by the people closest to them. And I would imagine that you’d tell yourself that that’s a sacrifice… that you make, but… as I get older, I look at it differently. I don’t know if I look at it as a sacrifice anymore. Maybe… maybe not. Maybe… they just ran from responsibility into the arms of ambition. You know, maybe Apple and Pixar… are just built off the back of one man’s inability to be intimate with the people closest to him. Or with himself. And so it recasts my own path, where I’m like, maybe this isn’t a sacrifice. I’m not comparing myself to… Steve Jobs and… Isaac Newton, you know. It’s a matter of scale.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n But even in the comedy world, even the people that I looked up to… When I started, all the people that I looked up to, they’re all either, like, prematurely dead, utterly miserable, or, like, sex criminals. So… where is this headed?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Where is this path going? Their greatness is predicated on their accomplishments, but we fail to recognize how they failed in their private moments. And I think that’s a masculine definition of greatness. Because, like, I don’t look at that as great anymore because they couldn’t confront who they were as a person. They couldn’t confront the emotional reality of their experience. That is greatness to me. To do that, that is a much greater thing. How great can something be if it’s built on avoidance? I think you have to… confront. And it’s scary. It’s a scary fucking thing to do. Like, I get it. It’s like totally scary for a lot of reasons. One, you can find out that the story you’ve been telling yourself about yourself isn’t true. You can find out that what you thought was like the harsh, brutal reality of yourself, you’re just resting on an easier narrative that could be subverted by something else. Like I used to tell myself stories about myself that have shifted over time. I used to tell myself this was a sacrifice. I used to tell myself that what I was doing up here was important, that it was fearless. That I was fearless for doing this. I had the balls to say shit that nobody else did. Things like that Michael Jackson joke, I’d be like, “That’s fearless. That’s a fearless fucking thing. You can get mad at me. That’s fearless. I’m willing to stand that down.” But as I get older, I’m like, “That’s not… I think it’s funny, but it’s not fearless.” Because my emotional experience is nowhere in there. I’m nowhere in that joke. I wasn’t molested, and I’m not a pedophile.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n That would be fearless.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n The most fearless pedophile joke you could tell is to be one and admit it publicly.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n No, worst-case scenario, worst-case scenario, the joke bombs and you don’t like it. You look at me, arms folded, shaking your head and say, “No.” Fortunately, that didn’t happen this evening, but it has happened. It could happen. You can get mad. You could think I suck. You could not like me. But, counterpoint… who are you?\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n I can barely see any of you, and I love none of you. So what is this power… that you hold over me? You’re not me. We are always our most terrifying audience. I believe that. That’s why it’s so funny when people say that, like, public speaking is the number one fear of people. They say, you hear that, “Public speaking is the number one fear of people.” It’s like, “Well, I’m sorry, was confront',\n","  'ing yourself on an emotional level not on that questionnaire?” The fuck you talking about, public speaking? I’m public speaking right now. It’s fine. I’m public speaking as a way to avoid confronting myself on an emotional level.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n This is all. Like, up here it’s, like, “Dopamine!” And if I were at home, it’d be like… (SCREECHES) (SCREECHES) I have used this to avoid so many… I can’t tell you how many relationships I’ve been in where I’ve been like, “Oh, sorry, I can’t hang out with you tonight. I have to go do a show.” Or more specifically, “Sorry, I can’t be there on your birthday. I need to go do this bit about how all my relationships fall apart.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s like just, “Do I need any of this?” And I think as men, we have this tendency to wanna process everything in our lives through, you know, intellect, or logic, or our thoughts, or our reason, things that we do, things that are tactile, and it’s like… you’re ignoring the entire emotional subset of your experience. And this idea that logic and emotions are separate, they’re not. Like your thoughts are not separate from how you feel. Your thoughts… Thoughts are just emotions in drag.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n It’s the same ecosystem. It’s hard to dive in… like that. Therapy’s a good way to do it. I think people… a lot of people need… They’re men… all men.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Yeah, I’m comfortable saying that. All men need to go to therapy for… 20 years. Like…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n Roughly. (CHUCKLES) Sometimes guys get mad. They’re like, “Fuck you, I don’t need shit, you pandering pussy.” It’s like, “Hey. You do.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)\\r\\n “What was that?”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n Women need therapy too. But usually when a woman goes to therapy, it’s because a man in her life didn’t.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)\\r\\n I started going four times a week. It’s a program, it’s called psychoanalysis, and it’s, uh… The reason you go so often is so that you don’t have time to close up. Like, if you go once a week, you have all week to just close back up, so you stay open throughout the week so you can access parts of yourself that are much harder to access normally. And so it’s very emotional. It’s very exhausting. It’s very trying. I cry a lot. I sob… The other day, I sobbed for, like, 20 minutes straight. And this is how fucked up I am. As soon as I collected myself, my first thought was, “That shouldn’t count toward my time.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) But that’s me trying to get out of that moment. Like that moment was hard to swallow, and so… joke, out, now we’re out of it. But I don’t think that’s how progress gets made. I think if you wanna make progress, you can’t take that left turn at a punchline. You have to go… You have to sit there and process it there. You have to go down. You have to take that Miss Frizzle Magic School Bus all the way. “We’re going to your emotional core!”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Look out your left window. Is that Mom going on a date instead of hanging out with you? Yes, it is.”\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n “Process it! Feel it!” You have to stay there, and leave it there. You can’t buy yourself out of the moment. Otherwise, the progress won’t get made. It’s very hard to do. And I’m up here and I, like, I want to bring you in. Like, that’s where this is going. Like I want… That’s the next step, is I want to bring you all to that place. But it’s h',\n","  'ard because, like, I don’t know if there’s a show down there. But I wanna bring you in, but I feel conflicted. I feel like I can’t… I have to like… I feel like that’s how this works, is I go in, I mine my own life for sadness, and then I contort it into a balloon animal for you so you don’t feel ripped off.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n I tried… to do that. I wrote… I wrote a joke… that tries to do that.\\r\\n Why did the chicken…\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)\\r\\n …cross the road?\\r\\n AUDIENCE: Why?\\r\\n Because… he grew up… with an untreated hearing loss… which deprived him of a major sensory connection to the people around him, and it isolated him to the point of chronic torture. And his parents were too caught up in their own drama and insecurities to attend to it, so he processed it as though there was something inherently wrong with him. And his feelings are a threat to his relationships, so he just suffered in silence, feeling like he was 100 feet underwater, wondering why nobody was coming to save him. And then, he finally started wearing hearing aids, which created this insane sensation of being able to participate in a world that he didn’t understand. But because his self-worth was predicated on how special he felt, he realized that the trodden path didn’t appeal to him. So he would get high and watch stand-up comedy as a way to numb the agony of how lost he felt. And in doing so, he found a lot of connection with their points of view, and he thought, “Wow, if I could do that, people could connect to me like that.” So he decided to drop out of school and pursue stand-up comedy, and doing comedy made him feel better for a moment, but it never forced him to address any of the reasons he actually felt like shit. He so badly wanted to feel special and powerful to make up for how worthless he felt, so he would say all sorts of fucked-up things, onstage and off, as a way to separate himself. And a lot of it he stands by, but there are a lot of things he said that were flagrant and unnecessary and hurtful and racist and sexist and homophobic, all of which he justified under the guise of pushing the envelope, which he thought was an act of justified rebellion against some arbitrary authority. But too late, he learned that a lot of those boundaries are derived from real people’s feelings and experiences and he was essentially exploiting their actual pain and using it as a traffic cone to satisfy this story he was telling himself where he was a genius. And just because people laugh at something doesn’t inherently make it good. They could be just as emotionally immature or ignorant as the perspective in the joke, or they could be responding to joke structure and timing more than content. And then, one day…\\r\\n (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)\\r\\n …all the world’s stages boarded up, so he sat alone in a room for a year, and he did nothing but talk to the walls and a therapist. And with no emotion to escape into, he slowly started breaking down the paradigm he’d constructed and moved into the feelings he was running from. And he discovered how badly he had been hurting his entire life, and what it actually is to hurt so badly. And he realized that there was not a single period of his life in which he was truly happy. And through that, he started to realize how much pain he had caused other people. He instantly regretted all the ways in which he’s needlessly made people feel like shit in order to protect his own conception of',\n","  ' himself as strong. Then he wanted to disappear from the world entirely because he felt like such an incredibly bad person for having done these things. So his instinct was to beat himself up about it and tell himself what a horrible person he is, but he’s been shaming himself his entire life, and all these things he did were just ways to push people away and deprive himself of any meaningful connection, because of how badly he felt about himself, because it was too scary and painful to be open enough to connect to anyone else. So, while he hurt people, he was hurting no one more than himself, and he doesn’t want to do that anymore. He has worked so hard to clear out space within himself and feel safer in his own body and treat himself like a friend he loves as opposed to an enemy he hates, which means he no longer tolerates dynamics based on his own self-destruction, which has changed numerous relationships in his life, including the one with the art form that he loves. The fear has always been that if he makes peace with the subterranean feelings that drive all of this, he’d lose this piece of himself which has helped him survive and get to this point, a fear that he won’t be funny anymore, he won’t be special, he’ll just be, which has been an intolerable notion because he doesn’t feel like enough on his own. He’s only known how to exist by chasing, or thinking, or running, or fighting, or straining, or suffering, or striving, or analyzing, anxious energy which ultimately manifests the very same emptiness it’s borne out of. And it keeps him locked into one side of himself, but he’s making every effort to find a way to not give in to those anxieties and sit with the quiet inside of himself because he wants so badly to get to the other side.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)\\r\\n Thank you very much.\\r\\n (APPLAUSE CONTINUES)\\r\\n Thank you.\\r\\n (AUDIENCE CHEERING)\\r\\n (MELANCHOLY MUSIC CONTINUES)\\r\\n (“CARNIVAL” BY COREY LAITMAN PLAYING)\\r\\n Well, I know\\r\\n It’s all you can do\\r\\n To put one foot\\r\\n In front of the other\\r\\n When the cold has got\\r\\n Your bones\\r\\n And there’s a virus\\r\\n Hiding out in your brain\\r\\n So if you’ve got to carve out\\r\\n Your sterile spaces\\r\\n And hide out inside\\r\\n Those high up places\\r\\n In the name of staying safe\\r\\n And keeping sane\\r\\n In this wind and this rain\\r\\n Oh Funny thing, I’ve been\\r\\n Watching you charm the crowd\\r\\n They’re laying down\\r\\n Their arms\\r\\n Oh\\r\\n They’re clapping out loud\\r\\n Oh, but funny thing\\r\\n You’ve grown so small\\r\\n It’s hard to see you\\r\\n There at all\\r\\n Well, I know It’s all you can do\\r\\n To put one foot\\r\\n In front of the other\\r\\n When the cold has got\\r\\n Your bones\\r\\n And there’s a virus\\r\\n Hiding out in your brain\\r\\n Oh\\r\\n So if you’ve got to carve out\\r\\n Your sterile spaces\\r\\n And hide out inside\\r\\n Those high up places\\r\\n In the name of staying safe\\r\\n And keeping sane\\r\\n In this wind and this rain\\r\\n Oh\\r\\n (MUSIC CONCLUDES)\\r\\n Your email address will not be published.

That almost makes me forget we’re all gonna be dead in a week. I’m kidding. It’ll probably be a month.\\r\\n Remember when we thought the pandemic was over? Everyone was so happy. “We did it!” We probably looked so stupid. Everyone was patting themselves on the back. “You know, I’m just glad I could help out the sick, by staying inside.” “It’s not over? Well, I’m not going back in.” “Those sick people have to die.” ‘Cause it’s not over. The pandemic is like a TV show you thought was canceled, and then it got picked up by Netflix. Oh… I didn’t really pace myself for another season.\\r\\n I don’t know about you, I wasn’t planning on seeing my family ever again. Parents know the feeling. It’s like changing that diaper in the middle of the night. You’re exhausted. It’s disgusting. But you have to do it. So you change the diaper, you finally get the sleeper back on, and as you gently lay the baby back in the crib, you hear the diaper fill up again. And that’s what the year 2021 is. Over and over. It’s just a diaper filling up over and over.\\r\\n I kind of miss the early days of the pandemic. Those were fun. Back when we thought washing our hands would protect us. “Everyone, wash your hands. We’ll be fine.” “Okay.” Remember before there were readily available tests, everyone had that friend that used to brag “Yeah, I already had COVID.” “I had it back in ’91.” “Yeah. Back then, it was called COVID-91.” “Had it a couple times. Got rid of it by washing my hands.”\\r\\n ‘Cause the symptoms were confusing. They’re still confusing. It’s like, “What are the symptoms?” “Everything.” “What do you mean, everything?” “Asking a question is a symptom.” “Well, that can’t be true.” “Denial is a major symptom.” Did you wipe down your groceries? I did that. It felt so silly. You know, like, “I’m just a normal guy cleaning a Triscuit box.” “Is this what OCD feels like?” Couple weeks later, you’re like, “Nah, they look clean to me.” “I cleaned ’em.”\\r\\n But you had to take the precautions. There was no uniformity. Everyone talked a big game, right? “Oh, we’re on lockdown.” “No work, no school, you know.” “We got our bubble.” “Bubble’s just my family and these two people we see at a weekly sex party.” “I figured, better safe than sorry.”\\r\\n ‘Cause we all went through the same pandemic, but we didn’t have the same experience, right? There were factors. Like, if you were 25 and healthy, you’re like, “Whatever. I’m going on a COVID cruise.” But if you were over the age of 25… And it may surprise you, but I am… …you watched the news more closely, right? The news guys would be like, “High-risk people are older.” You’re like, “Well, how old?” “Like old old, or didn’t-have-a-cellphone-in-high-school old?” Right? ‘Cause nobody thinks of themselves as old.\\r\\n The reality of your age just occasionally slaps you across the face. I did this benefit for a hospital. It was a fancy event. When I showed up, the woman running the event was like, “Oh, my gosh. We went to the same college.” She was younger, but we talked and we realized we hung out at the same places. At the end of the event, I was leaving and she ran up to me, she was like, “I need to know what year you graduated college.” I was like, “1988.” And she was like, “Oh, my gosh. That’s',\n","  ' the year I was born.” Slap! Right across the face. I didn’t even know what to say. I was like, “Ah, that’s the year I was born too.” She looked at me like, “That’s not funny.” And then I got in my car and stuffed food in my mouth until I stopped feeling anything.\\r\\n Sometimes you had to decipher the news. Right? The newscaster would be like, “The vulnerable are older and people with comorbidities.” You’re like, “Co what?” “Comorbidity.” Which eventually we figured out was just code for, “All the fat asses are gonna die.” But they couldn’t say that on the news. They couldn’t have Sanjay Gupta be like, “Well, Anderson, all the fat asses are gonna die.” So they said comorbidities. And at home, we were like, “Honey, what is a comorb…” “I don’t know. Pass the gravy.” In time, we figured out they were talking about fat people. And if you were overweight, you were like, “How fat?” Or like, “Are we talking Walmart fat or Jim Gaffigan fat?”\\r\\n I got the message. I dunno, I totally got the message. I started working out. I started eating healthy. I was going good. Then one day I looked in the mirror and I was like, “Ah, enough of that.” Turns out, life or death, not the motivator you’d think it would be. “You could live longer.” “Not a good enough reason.” “Can you sweeten the deal, maybe throw in a pizza?” I tried. I tried.\\r\\n My wife bought me a scale, so the romance is still alive. I didn’t ask for it. She gave it to me as a gift. I could never do something like that. “Happy birthday, honey. I bought you a scale and some makeup.” “Just lookin’ out for you, sweetie.” It’s a high-tech scale. Comes with an app so the government can know how overweight I am. I don’t know why there’s an app. Maybe so I can be the victim of Ransomware. “Pay up or we’re telling everyone how fat you are.” “But I don’t have any crypto currency.” I set up the app, stood on the scale, my weight showed up on the phone, 150 pounds. All right, it was over 200. All right, it was way over 200. If it was an old-fashioned scale, you wouldn’t see the number 200. But it was in the 200 family. And underneath my weight, on the phone, there was this word in small red lettering. I didn’t have my glasses on so I asked my daughter. I was like, “What does that say?” She was like, “Obese.” Slap! Right across the face. I just looked at my daughter, I’m like, “Ah, I gotta update this app.” And then I ran to the kitchen and stuffed food in my mouth till I stopped feeling anything.\\r\\n Still wearing masks. There was that time when nobody had to wear a mask, right? That was a fun day. Remember the first time you went out in public without a mask? It was weird, right? You felt naked. You were like, “Oh, I’m so European.” “What is this, the French Riviera?” I was kind of tempted to wear, like, a thong mask. You know, something tasteful yet naughty. “I can see his cheeks, but there’s still a mystery.” “Ooh-la-la.”\\r\\n ♪ Round and pale and mostly balding ♪\\r\\n ♪ The boy from Indiana goes walking ♪\\r\\n ♪ And as he does All the people he pass go ♪\\r\\n ♪ “Yuck!” ♪\\r\\n Initially, it was strange seeing other people’s faces without a mask. You wanted to go up to some people like, “You should stick with the mask.” “It’s a better look for you. You in a mask is better for everyone.” Did you meet anyone during the pandemic where you only knew them with a mask? And then when you finally saw them bare',\n","  'faced, you’re like, “Yikes.” You felt like you were catfished. You’re like, “Wow, your face doesn’t match your voice at all.” “And who stole your chin?”\\r\\n Of course, the biggest reveal of the pandemic was how many crazy people there are. That was a bit of a surprise. We all knew there were some Unabombers out there, but, nobody thought there were that many. Or that we were related to a couple of them. You know? ‘Cause everyone had that relative or friend that came out as bonkers. “I no longer believe in reality.” “Good to know.” It was like a gender reveal for insanity. “The truth is no longer true.” “See you at Thanksgiving.”\\r\\n I feel like it happened for me more often ’cause I’ve always had friends that are eccentric thinkers and they’re normally really entertaining. They’re like, “Bigfoot’s real, man. Bigfoot is real.” But that same person, at one point during the pandemic, was like, “Tom Hanks eats babies.” “Don’t say that.” “Tom Hanks does eat babies.” “And if you don’t believe that, then you eat babies.” “All right.” “Tom Hanks eats babies.” “He always seemed like a baby-eater to me.”\\r\\n The thing I missed most during the lockdown was restaurants. I know that’s a surprise. I didn’t even realize how much I missed restaurants ’til the first time I went out to eat and I caught myself catcalling other people’s food. “Oh, yeah.” “What I would do to you.” “Get me a fork and knife.” “Jim, you’re in public.” “Oh, sorry.”\\r\\n This is gonna kind of sound pandering, but I believe the pandemic has been hardest on mothers. Definitely hardest on mothers. Right? Or the men who had to live with those mothers. It was insane for… I don’t know how my wife did it.\\r\\n We had five children doing distance-learning. And my kids were good. They totally kept a distance from learning. We asked children to do school on the same device they play Minecraft. It’s like holding a Weight Watchers meeting in a Wendy’s. I mean, it was insane. I definitely gained an appreciation for how difficult it is to be a teacher. And what a poor career choice that was. Right?\\r\\n I guess it was, uh, after the first case of Scotch, I turned to my wife… …and I said, “When this is over, if there’s even an opening, I’ll take you wherever you wanna go. Wherever you wanna go.” My wife was like, “I want to go to Hawaii.” And I was like, “I was thinking more Tri-State area.” She was like, “I wanna go to Hawaii and I wanna bring the kids.” And I was like, “Whose kids?” She was like, “Our kids.” I did the research, saw that it was cheaper than a divorce, so we went to Hawaii. And… Hawaii is such a special place. It really is. It’s like there’s the “Aloha Spirit”, where people greet each other with “Aloha,” but I’m so awkward, so they’ll be like, “Aloha,” and I’ll be like, “Hello ha.” Does that mean something? That means…\\r\\n Even when I would use the Hawaiian terms properly, it would backfire. Like if I said, “Mahalo,” the natives would look at me like, “You don’t have to do that.” “Just nod your head and we’ll bring you pork.”\\r\\n ‘Cause I stuck out in Hawaii. I didn’t even look like a tourist. I looked like someone they brought in to make the tourists feel more comfortable. “You’re fine. You wanna see awkward, look at Jim Gaffigan.”\\r\\n Hawaii, it’s incomparable to any other state. It’s a tropical paradise. It’s almost like Hawaii was this Polynesian island nation that we just',\n","  ' took over. You know what I mean? Like, it wasn’t even part of the United States. We just went in like it was an open house. “Nice. Nice.” “We could do our honeymoon here. We’ll take it.” The Hawaiians were like, “We’re our own country.” “That’s cute. I love your flower shirt. Gotta get one of them.” And Hawaiians will tell you, they’ll come right up to you. They’ll be, “You stole this land.” And I’m like, “Don’t know how to break it to you, but we stole all the land.” “Probably just stings a little more ’cause it’s pretty here.” “Believe me, there’s people in Detroit pissed at us.”\\r\\n My wife chose Hawaii because my wife loves the beach. And as you can see, so do I. I spent the entire time applying and re-applying sunscreen which, thankfully, makes my skin whiter. What cruel bastard decided that the goo that protects pale people from the sun should also make them look like White Walkers? It’s… it’s just cruel. They should offer other colors. “Cool. There’s one of the guys from Blue Man Group.” I don’t even know why sunscreen is white. What was the thinking? “Well, you know, those pale people love ranch dressing, so…” “…let’s keep it in their wheelhouse.” ‘Cause I don’t tan. I don’t kind of tan. There’s no medium rare for me. I either look like I’ve never been outside, or I was just released from a burn unit. There’s no in-between.\\r\\n And I know people go to the beach to relax. People find the beach very relaxing. Not so much for me. It’s like being allergic to bees and then, for vacation, becoming a beekeeper. My one goal was to just not burn. I didn’t want to be the sunburned adult. You see a kid with a sunburn, you’re like, “Parenting is hard.” You see an adult with a sunburn, you’re like, “That’s an alcoholic.” Right? ‘Cause… A sunburn on an adult is like a scarlet letter for poor judgment. There is no excuse. “Well, I was caught off-guard this time.” “I didn’t know the fireball in the sky would be hot this time.”\\r\\n When we weren’t at the beach, we did activities. I went zip-lining for the last time. What is wrong with us? “Hey, you wanna feel like you’re about to die?” “Would you pay 200 dollars to feel like you’re about to die six times?” Why don’t you just walk into traffic? “Did you see that bus almost hit me? I feel so alive.” Why don’t you just take off your mask at a biker rally? You know? If you’ve been zip-lining, you know to slow down, you have to spread out your arms and legs. That supposedly slows you down. It also makes it look like a suicide. “Oh, if he didn’t wanna die, why was he doing the chalk outline?” It’s such a weird… How did they even come up with zip-lining? “Hey, you know how telephone poles have a wire between ’em?” “What if we just put the tourists up there?” “Why would tourists do that?” “Don’t know. Why would they pay to swim with sharks?”\\r\\n We did go snorkeling. I wasn’t worried for myself ’cause I figured sharks would look at my legs and be like, “Those can’t be real.” “I’m not gonna bite into another mannequin, that’s for sure.”\\r\\n Sometimes, when my family would go to the beach, I’d go for a hike by myself, which was boring, but I figured how to make it fun. I started bringing a ketchup packet, and halfway through the hike, I’d open up the ketchup packet and rub it on my hands and my face, then I’d just approach romantic couples. “Have you seen my wife?” “No.” “But you heard her sas',\n","  \"sing off to me, right?” “I can still smell her sin.” “Jim, that joke’s scary.” “That’s a scary joke.”\\r\\n The pandemic continues, but we’re… we’re also processing part of the pandemic. We went a year and a half with no weddings, no kids’ birthday parties, no family reunions, but it wasn’t all good news. Right? Right? Huh? Some things… I don’t think some things are coming back. Like parades. I think that might be a wrap on parades. There was never anything that impressive about a parade. You’re all like, “Hey, kids, look. People are… walking.” “Creating unnecessary traffic.” Before the pandemic, if you ran into a parade, you were never like, “Oh, cool, a parade.” You were always kind of like, “I hate humans.” The only people really enjoying the parade were the people marching in the parade. Even the people on the sidewalk were like, “How long is this?” Of course, the highlight of most parades is the marching band, right? And on TV, that bird’s-eye view of the marching band is so impressive, right? But on a street level, you always felt like you were being invaded by nerds. “Uh-oh. Here they come. Hide your Xbox.”\\r\\n But marching bands are amazing, right? They practice as much as the athletes. They’re always rehearsing. It’s amazing how much effort goes into creating something that no one really likes. I’m kidding. I know there’s some marching band people here and it… And then for those… You know, like… The reality is, a marching band can take a song… It’s pretty impressive… any song, and ruin it. You know, like, “Wow, I didn’t know I could hate ‘Uptown Funk’ that much.” You’re never listening to a song and think, “I wish there was a marching band version of this.” And I understand there’s some proud marching band people here. And in full disclosure, I could never be in a marching band ’cause I’ve had sex. “He’s… He’s gonna get beat up by a marching band.” No, I know that people cherish their time in the marching band, they do. But to me, it just seems like we’re dissuading careers in music. It’s like, “Oh, you wanna be a musician? Okay.” “Put on this Captain Crunch costume.” “At halftime, march around the field while we grab some hot dogs.” “Do that for a couple semesters, then we’ll see if you still wanna be a musician.”\\r\\n Did you know that…? I didn’t know this. Marching bands started as military bands. They would march armies into battle, and they were for morale and to intimidate the enemy. I don’t know how that would work. “Oh, no. They know Fleetwood Mac.” “Should we go back?” “What if Lindsey Buckingham is with them?” How did they convince someone playing a trumpet to march into battle… “Head on in there.” “Won’t they have weapons?” “You’re gonna fight them with music.” “If you survive, please wake us up in the morning with a…” I love it when trumpet players have the plunger at the end. Who came up with that? “You know, I was listening to you play the trumpet and it reminded me of when I clogged my toilet.” “I’d eaten six Big Macs on a dare, anyway.” “Uh, I brought my plunger. It’s kind of clean.” “If you could place it at the end of your expensive music equipment, and give me a ‘wah-wah.'” “Go ahead.” “Have you ever thought of becoming a plumber?”\\r\\n It’s ridiculous. People always know someone who looks like me. Wherever I go, once a week, someone will come up to me and go, “Hey, I know someone that looks like you\",\n","  \".” I never know what to say. “Well, tell him ‘Hi.'” “Encourage them to wear sunscreen.” And this person who looks like me never doing something impressive with their life. “Yeah, he mows our lawn.” “We don’t even pay him. He just does it.” That sounds like my gene pool. Occasionally, on social media, I’ll be sent photos of babies who supposedly look like me. “This baby looks like Jim Gaffigan.” People think it’s hysterical that I look like a pale, pudgy, bald infant who poops in a diaper. Sometimes, people get too cute. They’re like, “Hey, why does our baby son look like Jim Gaffigan?” I’m like, “‘Cause I slept with your wife.”\\r\\n Now if you think it’s humiliating to be told you look like a baby, you should know I’ve also been sent photos of cats that supposedly… …look like me. Not once or twice, we’re talking about dozens of different cats. Always the same message. “This cat looks like Jim Gaffigan.” I don’t know what they’re implying, you know. That I fathered a cat out of wedlock? When I was lonely after a show so I went for a walk and… an alley cat asked for a cigarette and… I said I don’t smoke and… well, we started talking and… before you know it, the sun was coming up. I never saw that cat again. I can still smell her dander. Now, if you think it’s humiliating to be told you look like a baby or a cat, you should know I was once sent a photo of someone’s kneecap… …with the message, “This kneecap looks like Jim Gaffigan.” – And you know what? – I did look like that kneecap. But I don’t know what they were implying, you know. That I fathered a kneecap out of wedlock? That I was lonely after a show and… I went for a walk and a kneecap asked for a cigarette and… and I said I don’t smoke and… we started talking. Before you know it, the sun was coming up. I never saw that kneecap again. Now, if you think it’s humiliating… …to be told you look like the fleshy, wrinkly part of a stranger’s leg… it is. Or, uh, you know, I thought it was. And then I had this realization. I figured out what had happened. You know, it all made sense. There might be one person in here that’s like, “Jim, you’re crazy.” But I think the rest of you will see the logic here. What happened is, this kneecap person, obviously, went to a plastic surgeon… Right? And said, “I would like my kneecap to look like the most underrated comedian in America.” Right? And the plastic surgeon said, “You mean John Mulaney?” And the kneecap person said, “No, Jim Gaffigan.” And the plastic surgeon said, “I don’t know who that is.” And then the kneecap person said, “He’s kind of a pale, pudgy guy who looks like a baby or a cat.” That’s probably what happened.\\r\\n That’s weird. I normally get told I look like other humans though. I, uh… In Utah, I always get told I look Mormon. I didn’t even know you could look like a religion. But apparently, I do. And I’ve done research. I don’t look like one of the founders of the Mormons. I don’t look like a present leader of the Mormons. I don’t even look like a guy who could have more than one wife. I just somehow look Mormon. Of course, the Mormons no longer practice polygamy. But for a while there, a Mormon man could have more than one wife. I don’t know if that was a selling point. ‘Cause I love my wife, and I can honestly say I don’t want another one. I feel like disappointing one person is enough. Could you imagine having tw\",\n","  'o spouses mad at you? And you couldn’t drink coffee? No, thanks.\\r\\n I hope it doesn’t sound like I’m picking on Mormons. Most organized religions have negative stereotypes. Luckily, I’m Catholic, so I don’t have to worry about that, all right. Sometimes people don’t believe me. Like, “Are you really Catholic?” “No, I’m just saying that to impress you.” “I wanna come across like I have good judgment.”\\r\\n At this point, it’s almost like Catholics are trying to lose followers. They’re like, “What else can we do? What else?” “Why don’t we make Bill Cosby pope? Let’s try that.” Catholics have made an art of shrinking their religion. Even back to the Great Schism of 1054 where the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholics split apart, the Orthodox were like, “We wanna celebrate Christmas in January.” And the Catholics were like, “We like pedophiles.” I know. That one’s hard for me too. And then there was the, uh, Protestant Reformation. You didn’t even know this is a religion history class, did you? No, there was the Protestant Reformation in the 1500s when Martin Luther, who probably thought he’d be the most famous Martin Luther… Right? He was like, “That’s it. I’m the king of Martin Luthers.” “Don’t be surprised if one day, I get my own holiday.” No, Martin Luther, he had those 95 problems, but a bitch ain’t one, right? ‘Cause at the time, the Catholic church was super corrupt. Thankfully, it’s not anymore.\\r\\n Some Catholics get really angry. “You’re so critical of Catholic church, why you even Catholic?” Because I believe human beings are inherently flawed. That’s one of the reasons. But mainly, I’m afraid of my wife. Huh?\\r\\n I don’t think there’s anything intrinsically wrong with organized religion. It’s just the human interpretation, right? Most organized religions, God’s saying a similar thing. He’s like, “I want you to love one another.” And the humans are like, “Got it, got it. He said kill gay people, so…” “Let’s get to work.”\\r\\n As a result, all organized religions are struggling right now. Muslims, they’re killing it. Muslims are like, “Oh, Catholics, you think you can alienate people?” “Hold my hummus.” “Let me show you how it’s done.”\\r\\n I’m sure some of you are looking at me like, “Hey, Jim, you look like a former Hitler Youth.” “What are your views on Judaism?” “I’d like to see you destroy your career tonight.” Well, I’m not frightened. I’ll tell you what I think. I think Judaism is perfect. There’s nothing wrong with it. And I’d like to be in more feature films. That’s… That’s some, uh… That’s some good old-fashioned pandering anti-Semitism.\\r\\n Really, the only organized religion, without a negative stereotype, is Buddhism. Right? You’d think more Americans would be Buddhists. ‘Cause if you look at Buddha, he kind of looks like an American. Buddha looks like someone you’d watch the game with. “Buddha always gets a keg for the playoffs.” “Buddha! Buddha!” You know, in real life, Buddha was thin. He wasn’t even a big guy. They made him heavy to make the religion more appealing. ‘Cause at that time, being heavy was a sign of success. Also at that time, being lighter-skinned was a sign of success. So back then, I would have been like Jeff Bezos, so…\\r\\n Bezos. Who’s your favorite billionaire-pretend astronaut? Hmm? Can you believe there’s a choice? And it’s not between just two. We live in a day when billionaires are bu',\n","  'ilding their own rockets to fly to outer space, and no one’s saying, “Are you sure they’re paying all their taxes?” “‘Cause I know some teachers that need supplies.” It’s like these billionaires are trying to execute the plan of a five-year-old boy. “When I grow up, I’m gonna be a bazillionaire!” “And I’m gonna build my own spaceship!” “And fly to outer space!” “Okay, Jeffrey.” “But now it’s time for bed.”\\r\\n I almost feel sorry for the accountants of the billionaires. ‘Cause they were like, “You had an amazing year.” “You made 40 billion dollars.” “But I fudged the numbers so it looks like you broke even.” “As long as you lay low and don’t draw attention, we should be fine.” “You got anything coming up?” “I built a rocket…” “…to fly to outer space.” “You know I meant to lay low on this planet.” “Does it matter if the rocket’s shaped like a penis?”\\r\\n I do enjoy the reasoning of the billionaires for going to space. They’re like, “I’m going to outer space so eventually you can go to outer space.” “I’m going so you can go.” “I don’t wanna go to outer space.” “I wanna go to Italy.” Why don’t you work on that?\\r\\n I saw a hitchhiker recently. You never see that anymore. Of course, we no longer refer to them as “hitchhikers.” Now we call them “murderers”. Which is what they do. They murder the nice people that give them rides. Talk about a lack of gratitude. “Thanks for picking me up.” Stab.\\r\\n Hitchhiking disappeared ’cause it was dangerous for both participants. Right? The hitchhiker and the driver. And, you know, at one point, there must have been like a murderer driving around looking to pick up a hitchhiker, and he picked up a hitchhiker who was also a murderer. And the driver was like, “I’m gonna kill you.” And the hitchhiker was like, “I’m gonna kill you.” And I bet they had a laugh. I bet they laughed. And then slowly but surely, “they fell in love.” “And that’s what my musical’s about.” It’s called Hitched.\\r\\n Flew in Thursday, uh, driving from the airport, I saw this guy on a motorcycle and he looked so happy. You know, and whenever I see a motorcycle that’s on the highway, I always have the same thought. “You’re gonna die.” “What are you doing on the highway? You’re gonna die.” And the only reason I say that is ’cause they’re gonna die. I don’t even know what the thinking is. “Well, I have to travel a long distance.” “Should I take the car or this motorized chair with no seat belt?” “If I sneeze, I’ll never walk again.” “Live to ride.” And then die!\\r\\n I heard the motorcycle before I saw it. We’ve all heard those loud motorcycles. “Wow, how small is his penis?” And I didn’t know that’s the reason some motorcycles are so loud is ’cause they want you to know they’re gonna die.\\r\\n I have friends that love motorcycles. Some women are really into bikers. They’re like, “I just like a man who’s dangerous, who can’t afford a car.” “And who’s definitely gonna die.”\\r\\n But bikers are fascinating, right? What a uniquely American subculture. They’re all about macho independence, right? They’re all about the independence. Like, “I just wanna be out on the road, just me and my bike, alone, with 30 other guys.” “In matching outfits.” “Riding in tandem so close, we can French-kiss each other.” He’s gonna get beat up by a marching band and a gang of bikers.\\r\\n Bikers are grown men who make the same phone calls of an eight-year-old boy. ',\n","  '“You guys wanna ride bikes tonight?” “Well, I don’t wanna go alone. It’s scary out there. Ask your mommy.”\\r\\n The reason that’s funny is ’cause bikers are so intimidating, right? They’re angry. Bikers seem angry, and I think it’s ’cause they’re cold. Right? That vest with no shirt? That’s gotta be chilly. “Oh, I wish I had a shawl.” “Shawl and my Uggs.” “Maybe a pumpkin spice latte.” That vest with no shirt is so common among bikers. Is there like peer pressure? “Look at Curtis over there, wearing a T-shirt under his vest like a girl.” “Let’s kick his ass.” “And then kiss him.”\\r\\n Occasionally, you’ll see a biker giving someone a ride on the back of their motorcycle, it’s usually a woman. Guys don’t wanna ride on the back. Mm. It’s hard to get a ride on the back of a motorcycle without giving an extended intimate hug. “Let’s get out of here, Virgil.” “You smell wonderful, Virgil.” “What is that, lilac?” “You’ve been doing sit-ups, Virgil?”\\r\\n During the summer, occasionally, you’ll see a bicyclist on the highway. See a cyclist on the highway, they’re always dressed like they’re competing in the Tour de France. “You’re losing!” “And you’re also gonna die.”\\r\\n Those bicyclists, they have to settle down with the helmet design. It’s all super aerodynamic. It’s like, “You’re not going that fast.” You’re riding a bike. You’re not in the movie Tron. And put on some clothes! What’s with the spandex? Are you on your way to wrestle Blue Man Group? How many Blue Man references you’re gonna have?\\r\\n You ever see a bicyclist on the highway and they’re not in spandex, they’re just in regular clothes? They look like they have a DUI. Should’ve Ubered.\\r\\n You never see a cyclist giving someone a ride, right? There’s no room. They’re already sitting on that door handle of a seat. “I’m just gonna sit here for five hours.” “I don’t know why I can’t have children.” Right, I’m going after the cyclist. What are they gonna do? Throw their baby bottle of water at me? “I’d chase you, but for no reason at all, I’m wearing cleats.” Are those cleats necessary? You’re in a Starbucks. “Do you have oat milk?”\\r\\n I think it’s interesting, people who ride bicycles are called “cyclists,” but people who ride motorcycles are called “bikers”? You know, that’s just the bikers bullying the cyclists. “Hey, we’re gonna take the name ‘biker.’ You can’t use it.” And the cyclist went, “Motorcycle doesn’t even have the word ‘bike’ in it.” “We don’t care.” “Also, we’re gonna dress like that guy from the Village People.” Sun-glass guy’s like, “Well, we were gonna do that.” “No, you’re gonna dress like rhythmic gymnasts.” “Okay.”\\r\\n Bikers and cyclists both dress like they’re on their way to a costume party. No other form of transportation has a uniform. You never see everyone on the cruise ship dress like pirates ’cause it’s not necessary. Bikers and cyclists, both on two wheels, nothing in common. It’s like they’re trying to be different. Even the placement of the handlebars… Some cyclists have handlebars in real tight, some bikers have their handlebars way up here. “Oh, this is comfortable.” “This reminds me of my Big Wheel.” “Now I know why I have my wallet on a chain.”\\r\\n You never see a unicyclist on the highway. You know why? ‘Cause they’re all dead. ‘Cause I killed them. You’re welcome. Is there any bigger attention-grab than riding a unicycle? I guess a pogo stick',\n","  ', right? What was the pitch for the pogo stick? “It’s a stick you can jump on twice and then fall on your face.” “Interesting. If you practice, do you get better?” “Not at all, no.” “I’ll take one.”\\r\\n But unicyclists, they act like they don’t want the attention. They always have that super casual look on their face, but their legs are so frantic. They’re always like… “Oh, hey, what’s going on, everyone?” “Oh, I’m not doing anything.” “Does anyone have three bowling pins I could juggle?” “I could annoy you with two unnecessary skills.” That joke takes way too much effort.\\r\\n Oh, you may have noticed that there’s a piano on stage. And, uh, some of you may be wondering, “Hey, why would Jim Gaffigan have a piano on stage?” And… What you may not realize is that I… do not play the piano. “Jim, that was…” “Really? Did he bring the piano just for that joke?” “That’s pathetic.”\\r\\n Good-looking crowd here. Wow. Very good-looking. Very good-looking crowd, huh? Well, not all of you, you know. Not all of you. But I’m not breaking any news, right? We know where we stand. Yeah, we learn from such an early age. Like, I remember kindergarten, the girls would chase the cute boys at recess, and let’s just say I didn’t do a lot of running. Or any running. I remember being five years old and going, “Oh, this is how it’s gonna be.” “I’m gonna have to write some jokes.” “And I’ll be hanging out with the fellas.”\\r\\n I still hang out with the fellas. All right, I had a friend during the lockdown who spent the entire time planning a guys’ weekend. Every time I talk to him, he would make it sound less appealing. “Dude, this is what we’re gonna do.” “We’re gonna rent a cabin for the weekend. Just guys, no women.” “I’m already out.” “No, no, no. Think about it. Just guys, no women.” “We’ll smoke cigars, play poker all weekend.” “Sounds horrible.” “You’re not thinking it through.” “Just guys, no women, for a whole weekend, like we’re in prison.” “I look forward to it.”\\r\\n Every year, my brother Mitch goes on a golfing trip with 30 men. Thirty men. They fly to Florida. They rent three houses. Ten men to a house. They play golf in the morning, they eat lunch together, they play golf in the afternoon, and then they go back to the houses, I don’t know, have sex with each other. I don’t know what they do. It sounds horrible. How much fellowship can you have? My brother is not gay and, obviously, I wouldn’t care if he was. But if he ever came out, he could be like, “I gave you so many hints.” “I literally vacationed with 30 men.” “We rented out a cul-de-sac.” “We played with sticks and balls all day.” “How clear did I have to make it?” I guess the point I’m trying to make is golf makes people gay. So… So the next time a friend says, “I’m going to play golf with the fellas,” just be like, “Enjoy.”\\r\\n No, I prefer mixed company. I do, you know. There’s a cliché that men are dumb and I have enough male friends to know that’s based on some truth. Every man in here has that friend that they occasionally look at and wonder how they hold down a job. And if you don’t think that about a friend, that means you’re the friend. Yeah.\\r\\n My friend like that is Ricky. He’s a great guy. Ricky and I, one time, we went axe-throwing. Don’t know if you’ve done that. Throw an axe, you drink a beer. You try and forget our democracy is in crisis and… At one point, Ricky turned to',\n","  ' me and he goes, “Hey, before axe-throwing, what did they use axes for?” “Uh…” “Chopping wood?” He’s like, “Really?” And I was like, “Don’t talk anymore.” And like a good friend, I ran home, turned it into a stand-up bit. And I kind of forgot about it. Then, like a month later, Ricky called me out of the blue and goes, “I did it. I did it.” “I built my own axe-throwing range in my backyard.” Yeah, he’s divorced. And… Then he immediately starts bragging. He’s like, “Yeah, now, I could throw an axe 20 yards and hit a bullseye.” I’m like, “That’s impressive.” “You know when that’s gonna come in handy? Never.” He’ll be like, “Hey, you never know.” I’m like, “No, I do know.” Even if someone broke in your house and you happen to be holding an axe, you’re not gonna be able to say, “Hey, can you come 10 feet closer?”\\r\\n I like having women around for many reasons, not least of which is, they’re attractive and men are not. You know? Like when a guy’s good-looking, it’s like a fluke of nature. And you know what all attractive men have in common? They kind of look like women. Right? That’s the only way straight guys can tell who’s good-looking. “Wow, he must be attractive. He barely looks like a dude.”\\r\\n Women are attractive and compared to men, they’re very clean. Men are gross. And make very little effort to not be gross. Like, if aliens visited Earth, they’ll be so confused. They’ll be like, “The attractive feminine gender is taking an hour to get ready and those hairy beasts are just ready?” “No wonder this planet’s always at war.”\\r\\n Men are gross and as they get older, grosser. When women get older, they become more elegant. As men get older, they look like they’re decomposing. You ever seen an old guy with the shirt off? He looks like the first draft of a human. What is that, a Simpsons character? Because when men get older, things stop working. The synapses stop connecting. Normally, brain’s like, “Every month, I’m gonna grow hair on this guy’s head. “Every month, I’m gonna grow hair on this guy’s head.” But one month, the brain’s like, “Every month, I’m gonna grow hair everywhere but this guy’s head.” I have hair growing in parts of my body… I don’t need. Do you wanna know why older men grow hair on weird parts of their body? That’s nature’s way of saying, “You’re done.” “Stop mating or I’m going to turn you into a throw rug.”\\r\\n I have some body hair, not as bad as some men, which is a relief, ’cause as you can see, I did not win the genetic lottery. I am bald, blind and pale. It wouldn’t surprise me if I woke up tomorrow with a tail. “Have you seen the comic with the tail?” “He’s very pale and the tail even has a bald spot.” I saw a guy this summer at the pool, he’s probably 60, had his shirt off. Not a lot of body hair. All body hair. For a second, I thought they were shooting a GEICO commercial. This guy was… He was so hairy I had to stop my youngest son from trying to pet him. “Let him smell your hand first, son.” This guy was hairy and he was walking around the pool with the confidence like he’d spent a lifetime dealing with hairy situations. No one said anything, but everyone had the same thought: “Please don’t go in the pool.” “No one’s prepared to see you shake dry.” And this man walked right by everyone, and he sat down next to an attractive woman. And I was so impressed. That woman could look beyond this man’s',\n","  ' appearance and focus solely on his wallet.\\r\\n Whoo!\\r\\n But we all wanna be good-looking, right? We all wanna be chased on the playground, right? Some people go so far as to get plastic surgery. They’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna sound desperate, but can you take a knife to my face?” “And make me pretty. Just keep cutting!”\\r\\n It’s kind of amazing more of us don’t get plastic surgery because we live in a beauty-obsessed society, right? There are studies. There was a Harvard study, that found that children believed good-looking people are nicer. That study also found that children are stupid. We definitely give good-looking people the benefit of the doubt. Like if a really attractive person’s quiet, we think they’re mysterious. If a fat person is quiet, we assume they’re thinking about food. And we are, we are, but there’s still a mystery. You don’t know what kind of food. All right, it’s cake. It’s always cake. But you don’t know what kind. All right, it’s red velvet.\\r\\n As a result, we just like being around beautiful people. You ever been out to eat and you have a waiter or waitress that’s really attractive? For a second, you’re like, “Wow, this is gonna be a good meal.” You ever have an ugly waiter, you’re like, “Should we leave?” I think that’s why buffets started. “You know what, I’ll get my own food. Thank you.” “I don’t need that mug near my entrée. You know what I mean?” “Jim, you’re a monster.”\\r\\n We follow good-looking people on social media, Instagram. Beautiful people have millions of followers and we like their photos and sometimes, we put a flame emoji. It’s totally socially acceptable. If you did that in real life, you’d go to jail. “Excuse me, sir, what are you doing?” “I’m following that lady.” “Uh, Can I ask why?” “I like to look at her.” “Can you give her this torch I brought her?” “And these prayer hands.”\\r\\n Everyone’s got to settle down with the prayer hands emoji. The overuse is ridiculous. Got a text from a friend, “See you at dinner. Prayer hands.” “No. No prayer hands. Are you not gonna make it?” “What are you suggesting? That we eat hands for dinner?”\\r\\n My wife is very good-looking. That’s right, I’m part of a mixed couple. It’s not fair. She’s good-looking, she’s smart, she’s creative. But you know what? Horrible taste in men. So it evens out. I’m happily married, but I would say, once a week, I catch my wife giving me a look, like, “I’m gonna have to let you go.” ‘Cause I disappoint her constantly. I do things that annoy. Like, here’s something I do that annoys my wife. I use the bathroom. I know. I shouldn’t, right? I get in trouble for not telling her I’m gonna use the bathroom. “You just disappeared. Where’d you go?” “I didn’t know I needed a hall pass.”\\r\\n I also get in trouble for telling her I’m gonna use the bathroom. “Uh, I’m gonna use the bathroom.” “Again?” “Are you okay?” “How many times is that today?” “You’re disgusting.” “What do you do in there?” “Mostly get away from you.”\\r\\n When my wife’s annoyed with me, she doesn’t give me the silent treatment. She’ll just take too long to answer a simple question. She’ll be standing a foot away, looking at her phone and I’ll be like, “What time do we have to do that school thing?” And she’ll just be like… “It’s in the calendar.” I’ll be like, “Uh, are you mad at me?” “No.”\\r\\n Recently, we learned that this couple that we’re friends with are get',\n","  'ting a divorce. And not surprisingly, my wife was very upset. With me. I wasn’t surprised ’cause this wasn’t the first time something I had nothing to do with was my fault. Trump’s election, the Kavanaugh hearings, that was my fault. And I apologize ’cause I unconsciously planned the whole thing.\\r\\n Now, I would never describe my wife as crazy, ’cause I like to be married. But I do think it’s interesting that if a man calls another man crazy, it’s a compliment. “Here’s my buddy, Joey. He’s crazy.” Joey’s like, “Oh, you’re just being nice.” But if I was like, “This is my wife, Jeannie. She’s crazy.” I even get nervous saying that. She’s back in New York, but you never know. ‘Cause if my wife was standing here and I was like, “This is my wife, she’s crazy,” I’d be dead. And all of you would applaud. You’d be like, “Well, that was a teachable moment. Yeah.” “We learned something.” No, we’re hanging in there.\\r\\n By the way, if at the start of the pandemic, you were in a relationship and you’re still in that relationship, you should get money, right? Right? Because before the pandemic, if you’d hear of a couple splitting up, you were like, “Oh, no.” But during the pandemic, when you’d hear of a break up, you’re like, “Oh, of course.” You felt for the couples that stayed together. “You’re still together? Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.” “Co-dependency, huh?” ‘Cause it doesn’t matter how strong your relationship was. At one point during the pandemic, you looked at your partner and thought, “I think I’d rather have the coronavirus.”\\r\\n I know that sounds horrible, but it’s true. Everyone had that moment where they’re like, “You know, how uncomfortable is that ventilator?” “I know I wouldn’t be able to talk, but does that mean I wouldn’t be able to hear her?” “Do they have a ventilator just for the ears?” “Jim, you’re a monster.”\\r\\n My wife’s an amazing mother. We have five children. Can you believe that? Five children. Thank you. Thank you. It is something I regret… …’cause there’s too many of them. There’s way too many. Sometimes at dinner, I just pretend I’m hosting a reality show… …called So You Think You’re Going To College. ‘Cause they all can’t go. They all can’t go, not if I’m getting that boat. I’m kidding. Obviously, I’m not getting the boat… not until I get a motorcycle, you know.\\r\\n My kids find me annoying. All children find their parents annoying, which is kind of ironic, given children essentially ruined their parents’ lives. Right? Parents give their children their time, their energy and their money, and we repay our parents with resentment. Have you ever seen an adult get a phone call from one of their parents? You’d think it was a debt collector. “Ugh. It’s my mom.” “Yeah, I know you took care of me for a quarter of a century, but now is not a good time.” “You know what wasn’t a good time? Giving up my dreams… …so you could be a general disappointment.”\\r\\n No, I would never suggest that children are God’s punishment for having sex. But an argument could be made. And he’s up there, “Oh, they’re enjoying that way too much.” “How can I get them to pray tomorrow?”\\r\\n I do love being a parent. It’s the most important thing I’ll do in my life. But it’s an insane proposition. You give your children everything. You give them everything and then just one day, they leave. They’re like, “See you! Thanks for nothing.” “I’ll let y',\n","  'ou know if I need help with a mortgage.”\\r\\n Sometimes they don’t leave, right? They just stick around. They turn into roommates. Not going to happen in my house. I already have a backpack for each of them. They’ve seen the bags, “What’s that?” I’m like, “When you turn 18, that’s your going-away present.” “Jim, you’re a monster.”\\r\\n I try to be a good dad. I feel like I make more of an effort than my father. My dad’s generation, they didn’t have to do anything. My dad never went to a parent-teacher conference. My dad didn’t even know I went to school. My father couldn’t be bothered to turn his head if something was happening behind him. “What the hell’s going on back there?” I don’t know if he couldn’t turn his head or if it wasn’t worth the effort. “What the hell is going on back there?” “Oh, we’re celebrating my birthday.” “Oh, keep it down. I’m watching Ironsides.”\\r\\n ♪ Happy birthday ♪\\r\\n ♪ To you ♪\\r\\n My children give me guilt trips I wouldn’t even contemplate. Like my daughter was in a play on Thursday and Friday, so I went on Thursday night and then Friday morning, she saw me with my rolly bag and was like, “Oh, you’re not coming to my show tonight?” I’m like, “You’ve never been to one of my shows.” “I do 300 a year.”\\r\\n My big plan was to teach my children responsibility by selling posters after one of my shows. So I texted my teenage daughter. I’m like, “Do you wanna sell posters after my show? I’ll pay you.” She texted back, “Great, sounds good.” Then I texted my teenage son. “Do you want to sell posters after my show? I’ll pay you.” He texted back, “No thanks. I don’t need the money.” He doesn’t have any money. He has my money. I just texted back, “You’re out of the will.” I’m kidding. He was never in it.\\r\\n If my father asked me to do something, he wouldn’t even stick around for an answer. “You wanna shovel the driveway?” Then he’d just leave. It was understood I was gonna shovel the driveway or move out.\\r\\n I was kind of frightened of my dad. My children treat me like some bank teller they reluctantly have to deal with. Once a week, they just appear in front of me. “Hmm… Mom said I could get a shark… …so I guess I need your credit card.” I’m like, “What are you talking about?” “He’s yelling again, Mom!”\\r\\n If my dad was in a room in the house, I wouldn’t go to that side of the house. “I’ll just pee outside.” And I had all these older siblings that used to send me in there to ask questions. “Go ask Dad if we can go to Dairy Queen.” “I’m not doing it. I’m not doing it.” “Go. You’re too young to kill.” “Dad?” “What the hell do you want?” “He said, no.”\\r\\n When I didn’t have kids, I didn’t understand my dad at all. By the way, if you don’t have children, none of this should make sense. Or even the concept of a Saturday night. When you don’t have kids, you’re like, “Saturday!” And when you’re a parent, you’re like, “Who can we pay to come to this house… …and watch this child?” And your standards drop so dramatically. Initially, like, “They should have a PhD.” And then you’re like, “Well, how long were they in jail?” “Murder? It wasn’t children, right?” “A Satanist? You’ll fit right in.”\\r\\n Any parent will tell you that, like, having children has enriched their lives. It’s exposed them to things they never thought they’d do. Like kids just… You end up doing things you never thought you’d do. Like for me, going outside. Y',\n","  'ou ever go outside with real little kids? You don’t even know what to do with them. You’re like, “Well, I normally just drink out here.” “Who wants to play a game of nap?”\\r\\n It’s weird when your kids have a friend that you’re not a fan of. “Oh, Tommy’s coming over? Well, I’ll be leaving.” “You can text me when Tommy is gone… …’cause he’s immature.”\\r\\n I wasn’t prepared for all the activities kids have. You pick up your kid and bring them to an activity, then to another activity. And if they don’t have an activity, you have to think of one, or they’ll smoke meth. You’re always looking for an activity as a parent. I took my kids to Ripley’s Believe It or Not. I don’t know if you’ve ever been that desperate for something to do. What can I tell you about Ripley’s Believe It or Not? It’s mostly not. It’s not interesting. It’s not even a lot of stuff. It’s like they just emptied out some drifter’s storage unit. I do admire that business model, you know. Most businesses attempt to establish trust with the customer. Not Ripley’s. Like, “Believe it… or not. We don’t care.” “We know you’re not coming back.”\\r\\n I’m still getting used to having teenagers. Recently, my 17-year-old daughter told me that she wants to be an actor, which is so crazy ’cause when I was that age, that movie Dead Poets Society came out, which is an amazing movie with Robin Williams, where he plays this teacher who inspires these students to seize the day, right? And one of the students wants to be an actor. And, you know, he joins the play and he invites his dad to see the play and after the play, he tells his dad that he wants to be an actor. Dad’s like, “You’re not gonna be an actor, that’s stupid. Waste of time and money…” The kid’s so distraught he kills himself, and then the teacher gets fired and all the kids stand on desks… Anyway, it’s a great movie. No, now… now that I’m the parent of a teenager, I realized that dad in Dead Poets Society was right. I’m kidding. I know the point of the movie is, “Don’t be a teacher.” My wife hates that joke so much.\\r\\n My kids, I don’t know what they think. I don’t even think my kids know what I do for a living. Or I should say I didn’t think they knew what I did for a living till last Halloween. My 10-year-old, Michael, didn’t know what he wanted to be for Halloween, which is a crisis. If you’re a parent, you know this. Then, like, two days before Halloween, he ran up to me and he goes, “I know what I’m gonna be for Halloween.” “I’m gonna be a stand-up comedian.” And I was so touched. I was like, “Oh, my gosh, for Halloween, you wanna be your dad.” And he goes, “No, I wanna be John Mulaney.” Slap! Right across the face.\\r\\n Thank you so much, you guys.

Thank you so much.\\r\\n Thank you. Wow.\\r\\n And–\\r\\n Another hand for the most overqualified opening act, Mr. Lewis Black.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n And another hand for Jann Arden, who couldn’t be here to sing that in real life but was nice enough to send that to me in the computer.\\r\\n And a big hand for you people that are borderline alcoholics.\\r\\n You’ve made it out tonight.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n You’ve–\\r\\n [cheering continues]\\r\\n I do feel a kinship. This is a beer town.\\r\\n I’m from a beer town. I’m actually from St. Louis, Missouri.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n Thank you. You like that.\\r\\n Specifically, I’m from very near Ferguson. Maybe you saw our travel brochure.\\r\\n People are like, “Really? Are you really from there?”\\r\\n Yeah, I am.\\r\\n They’re like, “Can you believe all that happened?”\\r\\n Yeah, I can.\\r\\n I can’t believe we kept a lid on that shit for 25 years.\\r\\n Every day I felt the tension. Every day.\\r\\n Even In high school, I came home and I said, “I don’t really know if our school’s that safe anymore, Dad. A girl got stabbed to death in the third-floor bathroom.”\\r\\n He didn’t stop doing the crossword puzzle.\\r\\n He goes, “Well, don’t use that bathroom. What are you, a goddamn idiot, Kathleen? Jesus Christ. Use your mind.”\\r\\n It’s not a very exciting state, Missouri.\\r\\n It’s really just in the middle–\\r\\n Clearly, though, to Southerners it’s not.\\r\\n I was in Birmingham, Alabama.\\r\\n I get done with the show, and this guy at the bar goes, “Ma’am, I could tell by the way you talk you’re a Yankee.”\\r\\n I’m like, “Sir, I’m from Missouri.\\r\\n And let me tell you this little piece of history.\\r\\n I don’t even know if we were in the war.\\r\\n I think we were half and half and just beat the crap out of one another.\\r\\n We never even left our own property, sir.”\\r\\n “Fight Local.” That was our bumper sticker.\\r\\n “Fight Local.”\\r\\n ’Cause we couldn’t decide.\\r\\n We were half Confederate and half Union. We still can’t decide.\\r\\n CNN had a map of the Syrian refugee crisis, a map of the United States, and who would take them and who wouldn’t.\\r\\n The South, yellow. No.\\r\\n The Northeast said yes, we’ll take ’em. Blue.\\r\\n For no reason explained till the very end of the show, Missouri was purple.\\r\\n The only state.\\r\\n And then at the end, they go, “Oh, the purple signifies no decision.\\r\\n They can’t make up their minds.”\\r\\n Of course we can’t make up our minds.\\r\\n I don’t really consider, um–\\r\\n I don’t know what I consider. I don’t know if it’s north or south.\\r\\n But I know sometimes when I’m in the South, I see things on bumper stickers, I read things in their newspaper where I think to myself, seriously, I think we may need to have this Civil War again.\\r\\n I’m not sure they got it.\\r\\n I feel like it’s beating up a drunk in an alley and then wake up and be like, “That was bullshit.\\r\\n I wasn’t ready. Come back.”\\r\\n No. No, drunky. We’re not coming back.\\r\\n I was in Louisiana, and you can google this.\\r\\n ’Cause I couldn’t believe this was true. It is true.\\r\\n They are teaching children in schools in Louisiana that will accept vouchers.\\r\\n So that’s tax money.\\r\\n They’re private schools, but they accept vouchers.\\r\\n This is in science class.\\r\\n Now, put on your science hat and try to follow this syllogism.\\r\\n They’re teaching the kids that the Loch Ness Monster is real.\\r\\n Now, as an aside, I agree with that.\\r\\n But nobody taught me that.\\r\\n I had to stay up really late watching the Discovery Channel, drinking a lot of wine and weeding through a lot of crap to make my decision.\\r\\n Anyway, they’re teaching the children that the Loch Nes',\n","  's Monster is real.\\r\\n Therefore, evolution is not real ’cause the Loch Ness Monster is a dinosaur.\\r\\n I don’t even have a joke for that. I just want you to know that.\\r\\n Those are fellow Americans that I think should be airlifted out. I–\\r\\n Someone needs to get the children. Leave the adults.\\r\\n Take the children.\\r\\n My state is not a state that you really wanna brag about.\\r\\n We just try to lay low. That’s our best outcome: if we’re not noticed.\\r\\n Because every time– Like Ferguson, that whole thing.\\r\\n That was not exactly something that you feel proud of.\\r\\n Uh, two summers ago, I turned on CNN somewhere on the road, and it said, “Missouri State Senate debates–”\\r\\n Now, you think the next word would be “health care” or “right-to-work clause.”\\r\\n No. “Noodling.”\\r\\n Yeah. We spent two weeks, eight hours a day, the senate.\\r\\n For those of you who don’t know what noodling is, congratulations.\\r\\n You have led a very classy life.\\r\\n But I’m gonna tell you what it is.\\r\\n Noodling is when hillbilly people get in muddy rivers, like the Mississippi or the Missouri River, and they get into water about chest high and then they go along the riverbank with their hands underneath the water searching for catfish breeding holes.\\r\\n Then when they find one, they shove their arm in the hole.\\r\\n They wait for the catfish to bite it.\\r\\n Then they yank it out and they’ve caught a fish.\\r\\n I was not aware that this is illegal in my home state of Missouri.\\r\\n I was also not aware that it is legal in our neighboring state of Oklahoma.\\r\\n I certainly was not aware that we have a Missouri Noodlers Association.\\r\\n CNN sent a young reporter to interview the president of the Missouri Noodlers Association, who immediately became my new hero because for his interview on CNN, he chose not to wear a shirt.\\r\\n [audience cheering]\\r\\n She was clearly petrified of the guy.\\r\\n I have never seen anyone hold a microphone further away from another human being.\\r\\n She said, “Sir, I understand you’re the president of the Missouri Noodlers Association.\\r\\n Could you please tell us your position on noodling?”\\r\\n He goes, “Yeah. Yeah.\\r\\n I’ll tell you my position.\\r\\n If I wanna shove my arm in a hole and get a fish, you tell my why I can’t.”\\r\\n So that was the argument for it.\\r\\n Then I thought, what is the problem? I don’t know.\\r\\n Well, they go interview the people against it.\\r\\n It was, like, basically an environmental group, and they go, “Well, our problem with it is two-fold.\\r\\n Number one, every time they do this, they’re destroying the catfish breeding holes.\\r\\n And number two, and more importantly, sometimes these catfish, especially if near a dam, can grow to be 150 to 250 pounds.”\\r\\n Yes. I swear. Google it.\\r\\n “So sometimes when the hillbilly shoves his arm in the hole, the hillbilly does not come back up.”\\r\\n But I was like, “Yeah, but let’s think that through.\\r\\n What have we gained and what have we lost?”\\r\\n Everything–\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n “We might have lost Billy Bob, but somebody just got his brand-new truck full of Busch light.”\\r\\n What?\\r\\n I don’t expect people to know much about Missouri.\\r\\n I do expect people to know it’s a state. That I do.\\r\\n And there are people–\\r\\n I was in California, in a Macy’s, trying to buy jeans.\\r\\n And the girl was young, I’ll give her that.\\r\\n [imitating valley girl] She was one of the girls who talk like that, and she just couldn’t be bothered with anything, okay?\\r\\n [normal voice] I go to check out and I give her my credit card.\\r\\n She goes, “I’m gonna need to see your license.”\\r\\n I go, “Okay, that’s not a problem.”\\r\\n And I–\\r\\n I’m still not sure exactly what happened. I’m gonna show you what happened.\\r\\n I gave her my license, and she went, “Missouri.” [clicks teeth]\\r\\n “Uh… no.”\\r\\n “No? Did you just do a search in your brain and your hard drive came back with nothing, so you negated my whole state?”\\r\\n “Uh, no.”\\r\\n Missouri is a very special place to one group of people, and it’s the Mormons.\\r\\n Not the ones that went to Utah.\\r\\n Joseph Smith, the leader, h',\n","  'ad a son, Joseph Smith, Jr.\\r\\n That man believed that the original Garden of Eden was 35 miles north of Kansas City.\\r\\n Not in Mesopotamia.\\r\\n No, no, no, no, no.\\r\\n Missouri.\\r\\n They also believe that when Christ comes back, that’s where he’s going.\\r\\n First stop, Kansas City.\\r\\n He’s not gonna go to Bethlehem or Jerusalem.\\r\\n He’s getting a Southwest flight and he’s going straight to Kansas City.\\r\\n Look, I am from Missouri.\\r\\n And if you think Jesus is going back to Kansas City, 35 miles outside of it, by the way, then you must believe that Jesus is a big fan of barbecue and crystal meth, because that is what’s happening 35 miles outside of Kansas City.\\r\\n My whole family lives there.\\r\\n Well, my parents are in Florida in the winter right now.\\r\\n As most Midwest old people with a car, they leave on December 26.\\r\\n They’re like geese. They just leave.\\r\\n Flocks of ’em leave from the Midwest.\\r\\n My parents bought a new car. They haven’t had a new car in ten years.\\r\\n They bought a black Lincoln Town Car.\\r\\n Little did they know that that’s one of the more expensive rides on the Uber app.\\r\\n So I, unbeknownst to them, have signed them up to be Uber drivers… so they can pick up other old people on the way to Florida, make a little spending cash.\\r\\n ’Cause my mom will do whatever the phone says, I’m telling you.\\r\\n “Jack, we have to pull over. We’re the blue dot, and it’s saying pull over. There are people that need a ride for some reason. I don’t know why the phone is doing this. It’s never done this before. But I’m afraid if we don’t, there’s gonna be a problem, Jack.”\\r\\n They go to Sarasota now, on that side.\\r\\n But for about three years in a row, they went to a place called the Villages.\\r\\n I don’t know if any of you’ve seen it advertised on TV.\\r\\n Go to their Web site. There’s nothing like it in the world.\\r\\n It’s the largest retirement community in the nation.\\r\\n Well, the world, probably.\\r\\n It’s 35 minutes, or if my mom’s driving, eight and a half hours away from the Orlando airport.\\r\\n Some guy thought of it.\\r\\n He thought, “I’m gonna buy all of this crappy swampland, and I’m gonna make nirvana for old people.\\r\\n I’ll build it. They will come.” And they came.\\r\\n There’s 350,000 of ’em.\\r\\n They have their own zip code. They have their own post office.\\r\\n They’ve got golf courses, swimming pools.\\r\\n I mean, it’s really something. It really is something.\\r\\n And my parents were there, and I go, “Oh, good. You’re gonna be at the Villages. That’s great, ’cause I have shows in Florida, and I have nowhere to go in between shows.”\\r\\n My mom goes, “You can come over here, but you can’t spend the night on the property.”\\r\\n I said, “Why not?”\\r\\n She goes, “The law at the Villages, Kathleen, is no one under the age of 55 is allowed to spend the night on the property.”\\r\\n I said, “Really? Fifty-five? So you’re telling me at age 48, I’m gonna have to again go get a fake ID–\\r\\n [audience laughing]\\r\\n so that I can spend the night with you freaks. Mom, where would I even go? To, like, a bingo game and roll an old redheaded lady and go, ‘Sorry. I’ll have this back in two days. I just need it to get into the Villages.’”\\r\\n I said, “Mom, how are they gonna know if I’m there? Seriously. Does an old man come in a golf cart and do bed check every night?”\\r\\n She goes, “Yes. That’s what I’ve heard. Yes. That’s what I think happens.”\\r\\n I said, “Well, I’m going to come there and I am gonna spend the night. But I will meet you halfway so you’re not nervous. I’m gonna sleep in my tennis shoes, sports bra and T-shirt and shorts. And if I hear the golf cart, I’m gonna get up, and I’m gonna run into the family room, and I’m gonna hide behind the La-Z-Boy. ’Cause in my own mind, Mom, I’m gonna pretend like I’m in the last scene of The Sound of Music and we’re the Von Trapps on top of the convent hiding behind tombstones… from the Nazis.\\r\\n And then when the golf cart guy shines his flashlight, just for my own amusement, I’m gonna pop out from behind it and go, ‘Don’t do i',\n","  't, Ralph. You’re not one of them. Don’t take us. Come with us.’ And then I’m gonna laugh and laugh. He won’t laugh, but I don’t care. It’s not the point. I’m gonna laugh. And then I’m gonna run by him, Mom, and I’m gonna run away, and I’m gonna make it over the whole border of the Villages. I’m gonna make it to freedom, and–\\r\\n Do you know how I know I’m confident I can do that? Because I’m the only person out of 350,000 that has both of their real knees, Mom. I am the Usain Bolt of this community. I don’t think you’re respecting my powers.”\\r\\n Prepared to getting older, there’s moments where you’re hanging out with them and you’re like, “Wow. Are you actually going crazy in front of me? Like, should I call someone? I don’t know what to do.”\\r\\n I was in Target with my mom. She opened her wallet and all her credit cards were individually wrapped in tin foil. She unwraps one and hands it to me as if that’s a completely normal exchange of information. I go, “We’re not gonna talk about that?”\\r\\n She goes, “Talk about what, Kathleen?”\\r\\n I go, “The tin foil, Mom. The tin foil.”\\r\\n She goes, “Well, obviously, you have not been keeping up with the news.”\\r\\n I said, “No, I actually thought I had been.”\\r\\n “Well, then you must have missed the story about the raygun people.”\\r\\n “Who are the raygun people?”\\r\\n She said, “Well, your father and I saw it on ‘20-40’ or ‘60-80’ or ‘100 Minutes,’ whatever those serious– It was a very serious program. There are people now, Kathleen, with computer rayguns, and they can shoot that raygun through my purse, through my wallet, and they gather all of your personal information off of that strip on the back of your debit card. They can shoot through your father’s ass at a gas station, right through his ass, into his wallet.”\\r\\n I went, “Okay.” My mom’s not stupid. She was a nurse for a million years. So I called my friend in Boston who’s been a cop forever, and I asked him about the raygun people and told him about the tin foil.\\r\\n He said, “Two things, Kathleen. Number one, no. I have not heard about the raygun people. But in fairness to your mom, I haven’t checked my work e-mail in three days. Now– Number two, and more importantly, what I do know from being a cop for 20 years is that crazy people love tin foil. You don’t need to tell your mother. I’m just telling you so you know that is a fact. An old cop told me that. Always carry tin foil in your squad car. If you come across someone who’s mentally ill and having a psychotic break or maybe someone in a drug frenzy, you just tear off a piece of tin foil, you calmly walk over and go, ‘Make a hat,’ and the whole situation–”\\r\\n They drive to Florida ’cause my mom won’t fly anymore. The fear of flying has literally gone over the edge with her. It started years ago.\\r\\n And I do feel sorry for people who have that fear, ’cause it is real.\\r\\n And you see people at airports. You can always tell.\\r\\n ’Cause their hands, their palms are real sweaty. They’ll talk to anyone.\\r\\n God forbid the time of departure changes.\\r\\n Then they completely unravel. They’re like, “This is it.\\r\\n I think this plane’s broken, and they’re gonna fly it. Don’t you?”\\r\\n “Yeah, I do. Today is the day.\\r\\n American Airlines is gonna go, ‘Fuck it. Give it a whirl. I don’t care.’\\r\\n Wha– Every part can’t be that important.”\\r\\n But it’s weird to me that strangers– There will always be a stranger who will say to another stranger, “Oh, you shouldn’t have a fear of flying, because I’ll tell you what, you have a better chance of being in a car crash than you do of being in a plane crash.”\\r\\n And I wanna say, but I won’t ’cause it would be mean, “Yeah, but you have a much better chance of getting in a forgettable car crash than you do of being in a forgettable plane crash.”\\r\\n There’s no way you’re gonna be in a plane crash, go to work on Monday, and then Wednesday look at somebody you work with\\r\\n and go, “Oh, shit, did I forget to tell you?\\r\\n On the way home from Milwaukee, my plane crashed.\\r',\n","  '\\n I don’t know if you saw that on CNN. I was the lady running through the cornfield.\\r\\n My hair had caught on fire because I’m near-sighted and I’d lost my glasses in the turbulence.\\r\\n I actually ran towards the explosion versus away from the explosion.\\r\\n That’s why I called in sick yesterday ’cause… my head hurt ’cause it had been on fire.”\\r\\n I fly every week, and I’ve never even thought about what if something happened to the plane until missing Malaysian Flight 370, which I am admittedly obsessed with.\\r\\n My youngest brother, who I talk to almost every day, has banned me from speaking about it.\\r\\n He goes, “Seriously, Kathleen, if you bring it up, I’m gonna hang up.\\r\\n It’s been almost two years.\\r\\n I don’t wanna hear anything that you’ve read on the Internet.\\r\\n I don’t wanna hear what you and your drunk friends decided happened to it.\\r\\n I–”\\r\\n He goes, “You’ve never been obsessed with a plane crash.”\\r\\n “Ah, ah, ah. What is the problem with that sentence, Pat?\\r\\n You just said ‘plane crash.’\\r\\n We don’t know if this plane crashed, do we?”\\r\\n That’s– That’s why I’m obsessed with it.\\r\\n About seven months ago, they found a wing of a Triple Seven in the Indian Ocean.\\r\\n That’s what that plane was, a Triple Seven.\\r\\n And they sent that wing to the French.\\r\\n I do not know why the French are in charge of science.\\r\\n I’d have given it to the Germans. But whatever.\\r\\n They actually came out and said, “Well, yeah, um, this definitely is the wing of a Triple Seven, but we cannot confirm it’s missing Malaysian Flight 370.”\\r\\n “Well, has anyone else called… Lost and Found… looking for a wing?” They found another little piece, like, three days ago. But all it says is that– It just says, “Do not step here.”\\r\\n So it could be that or a ladder.\\r\\n Who kno– Nobody– Nobody knows.\\r\\n I watched every minute of the coverage, and my brother goes, “I don’t get it.”\\r\\n I go, “Because it’s the biggest news story of our lifetime, Patrick.”\\r\\n I’m sorry.\\r\\n I’ve assumed my entire life that when we bought a ticket in an airplane to go over a large body of water, I thought the whole time we were up here, someone smarter than us on the ground at all times knew where the fuck we were.\\r\\n I did. I believed that.\\r\\n Yeah, well, that’s certainly not the case. Cat is out of the bag.\\r\\n They got nothing.\\r\\n Boston to Dublin, Texas, when you get there, man.\\r\\n It gets a little weird after Nova Scotia.\\r\\n They don’t tell people that.\\r\\n As soon as you get a Guinness, give us a holler and let us know everything’s all right.\\r\\n They covered it on CNN for 72 days, and people were complaining it’s too much coverage.\\r\\n I’m like, “No, it’s not. This is wonderful.”\\r\\n ’Cause they have no new information, so now they just have to make up conversation.\\r\\n It got to the point where the experts were, like, building paper airplanes, going, “Okay, here’s what I think happened, all right?\\r\\n It was windy. Come on. Turn on the fan. Stay with me, Bob.\\r\\n Somebody put water in the trash can. That’s my ocean. Come on.”\\r\\n But I watched it, because every day they would go live to the city of Kuala Lumpur to a Hilton hotel for a press conference from the Malaysian Airlines spokesman.\\r\\n I have never felt so sorry for any individual in their job.\\r\\n Because every day he had no new information.\\r\\n And he had to face a ballroom full of Chinese people.\\r\\n ’Cause there were 239 missing people. Most were Chinese.\\r\\n Their families have been flown in. He couldn’t even make eye contact.\\r\\n He would just come out and go, “Brrrr. Ah, ha, yeah.\\r\\n Well, uh, once again, I have new no information on Flight 370.\\r\\n It’s a very bad situation.\\r\\n We cannot find our airplane.\\r\\n We have called Australia.\\r\\n They’re gonna help us look for our airplane.\\r\\n Sometimes you lose something.\\r\\n You can’t find it, and you have to ask for help.\\r\\n ‘Hey, have you seen my keys?’\\r\\n That’s the kind of situation.\\r\\n Sorry.”\\r\\n Then he would leave.\\r\\n I’m like, “This is a real airline. They’re open. Today. I check every day. I google. Thi',\n","  's is a real working airline.”\\r\\n And the Chinese people were so kind, I thought. Like in patient.\\r\\n He would come out day after day.\\r\\n There’s nothing. There was very little reaction.\\r\\n Week three he came out.\\r\\n “Ah, brrrr. Ah, yeah, once again, I have no new information on flight. We still cannot find our airplane. It’s a really, really, really bad situation. We do know this now though. We have been looking in the wrong ocean. Ha ha!”\\r\\n What? What?\\r\\n What? What?\\r\\n “Ah, yeah, that ocean wrong. Maybe now over here. We’re gonna look over here in this ocean.”\\r\\n What?\\r\\n The wrong ocean?\\r\\n That is an acceptable statement in the year 1492 regarding a boat.\\r\\n “I don’t know where it went, man. I told you the world was flat. Maybe it just fell off. I don’t know.”\\r\\n That is not an acceptable statement in the year 2014. Unbelievable.\\r\\n And once again, the Chinese people, they just didn’t really react.\\r\\n And I thought, “Oh, my God. That’s– That’s the day where my Irish temper– Every– Every single valve would have burst.”\\r\\n I could’ve had a can of Aqua Net and a lighter, and that man would have burst into a pillar of fire.\\r\\n A biblical pillar of fire on CNN International.\\r\\n And I would’ve done it knowing full well I’m gonna be arrested and tried for murder, which would’ve been fine.\\r\\n And I would say, “Yes, please let me take the witness stand.”\\r\\n ’Cause I don’t care what question I’m asked. I have a two-word answer.\\r\\n “Miss Madigan, is it true that you took Aqua Net and a lighter into the ballroom?”\\r\\n “Huh. Wrong ocean. Ha!”\\r\\n “Wrong ocean.”\\r\\n Unbelievable.\\r\\n The Chinese people, though, are still pretty kind.\\r\\n Day 72, for those of you who are not obsessed with missing airplanes, um, that’s the last day of hope because the ping device can no longer possibly operate.\\r\\n There’s the black box and then there’s a ping thing that emits a sonar sound.\\r\\n Now, this is assuming one had put batteries in their ping device.\\r\\n Yeah. Google this.\\r\\n About five months ago, they had a little secret announcement ’cause they thought everybody forgot.\\r\\n “Ah, yeah, one more thing. Ha ha. About that airplane. Um, we never had batteries in that. Yeah. Sorry. Well, you know, sometimes at home your remote control, your batteries go dead, and you go to a different remote control, and you take those batteries and you put ’em in this remote control. And then later on, you go for the other old one. You go, ‘Uh-oh. I forgot.’ That’s what happened. Sorry.”\\r\\n They are open.\\r\\n So day 72.\\r\\n At the time the Chinese people don’t know that there’s– They don’t know there’s no batteries. They believe there were batteries in it.\\r\\n He comes out, and I thought, “Whatever you do, just don’t say it the same way. Phrase it differently.” No. No.\\r\\n He came out, “Brrrr.\\r\\n Ah, ha, yeah, once again, I have no new information on Flight 370.”\\r\\n And finally, the Chinese people lost their minds.\\r\\n An old man, like, rolls back, flicked a lit cigarette at that man’s head, live on TV.\\r\\n Sadly, my first thought was, “Wow. You can still smoke inside… in a Hilton in Malaysia.”\\r\\n Note to self: Vacation in Kuala Lumpur.\\r\\n Take different airline. Check Southwest. That airline’s ridiculous.\\r\\n And then the older women started losing it.\\r\\n Like, literally, having heart attacks. 911 is being called. It’s bedlam.\\r\\n They have finally reached their maximum potential of patience.\\r\\n They’re out of it.\\r\\n I happen to be home watching it with my parents.\\r\\n My dad, who does not like public displays of emotion, was like, “Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. They got to get it together. They got to get it together. Do they know they’re on television? Are they aware that people can see?”\\r\\n My mom interrupts with– And I have six siblings.\\r\\n “Well, Jack, you have to understand it’s extra sad for the Chinese people because they only have one child.”\\r\\n I go, “Hold on a second. So are you saying, Mom, it would only be a seventh as sad if I went missing forever?”\\r\\n “Yes, that’s what I’m saying. Yes. You may n',\n","  'ot wanna hear that, but that’s the truth. I mean, we have six other children. They have children. Your father and I have casino buffet tickets. We are leading a full life.”\\r\\n Yes, you are.\\r\\n Seven kids. It’s too many.\\r\\n Nobody notices though. That’s a good thing.\\r\\n If you’re one of seven, no one notices anything.\\r\\n Like, I’m surprised– I have friends who have one or two kids.\\r\\n They speak to them about their feelings and their thoughts, and they address them individually.\\r\\n ’Cause my friends are like, “Oh, you guys didn’t?” “No.”\\r\\n No. Not with seven kids.\\r\\n There were just announcements made. That’s all.\\r\\n “We’re moving.” “Oh, fuck. What? What? What? When?”\\r\\n “Your mother’s already in the car. I don’t know what’s going on with you people.”\\r\\n Nobody notices when you’re one of seven.\\r\\n Which was fine with me. I didn’t mind that. I would still choose that.\\r\\n But sometimes to the point of, “Really, guys?”\\r\\n I do not watch myself on TV.\\r\\n I was 35 years old, and I walked into my parents’ house, and they somehow had me on their TV, and I looked at it and I go, “Ah. What is wrong with my eye?”\\r\\n My dad goes, “You mean your lazy one?”\\r\\n “What?\\r\\n What?” “Yeah, your right eye.\\r\\n When you get tired or nervous, it twitches and kind of jumps around.\\r\\n You– You don’t feel that happening?”\\r\\n “No. No, I didn’t know. I didn’t know that was happening. How long has that been going on?”\\r\\n “I mean, since you were a baby. I mean, they, uh… told us to put a patch on you, but you can’t have a baby girl pirate. That’s crazy. So, uh… we thought you’d grow out of it, quite frankly, and clearly you have not, Kathleen. So if I were you, before you go on television, I would get a nap or calm down, ’cause it’s–”\\r\\n I didn’t really know how small families worked till I got to go over to other friends’ houses.\\r\\n When you’re in second grade or whatever, my friend across the street, Bob, he would say, “That’s my mom and that’s my sister.”\\r\\n And I’m like, “Well, where is everyone?” Like, I don’t wanna say anything.\\r\\n Maybe there was a house fire or, you know, some sort of tragedy.\\r\\n But this is weird.\\r\\n I think smaller families are kinder. They say kinder things.\\r\\n I don’t know if they mean them, but I heard “I love you” a lot.\\r\\n “I love you.” “love you too.” “Love you more than yesterday.”\\r\\n “Ha! Love you more than tomorrow.” And it’s not even today.\\r\\n I would just stand there paralyzed and uncomfortable.\\r\\n “You guys don’t say ‘I love you’?” “No.”\\r\\n There are nine people in my house.\\r\\n Saying “I love you” would be a sign of weakness.\\r\\n They need to wake up and wonder how I feel about their ass.\\r\\n I’m not giving them that.\\r\\n And at this age if I walked into a room and all my siblings were sitting there and they started to say “I love you,” I’d run out because I would know this is some sort of intervention, and I’m not falling for that. I’m not listening to your dumb-ass sad letter.\\r\\n “Dear Kathleen.”\\r\\n We went to Catholic schools.\\r\\n Uh, yeah, I didn’t mind.\\r\\n [man] Whoo!\\r\\n If I had kids, I would make them go to a Catholic school, ’cause I’ll tell you, the one thing I guarantee you, if you send your kids to a Catholic school, they will never join ISIS.\\r\\n Somebody would’ve said to me at age 18 after all that Catholicism, “Hey, could we talk to you about our religion for a minute?”\\r\\n Ha ha ha ha ha ha!\\r\\n “No, you may not. You are 18 years late to this party, Muhammad. You–”\\r\\n [Kathleen chuckling]\\r\\n I think being Catholic is Christian, but it’s been pointed out to me many times in the South that they’re not the same.\\r\\n ’Cause in the South, they’ll go, “Oh, are you Christian?”\\r\\n I’ll go, “Yeah, I’m Catholic.” “Oh, well, we’re Christian.”\\r\\n “Oh, okay. I thought we said the same thing, but I guess not.”\\r\\n There are differences.\\r\\n The Christians have a direct relationship with Jesus. They speak of it like that.\\r\\n “You know what? Me and my relationship with Jesus. I love Jesus. Jesus loves me.”\\r\\n It’s a direct, very solid relationship with Jesus.',\n","  '\\r\\n And I thought, “Wow. Really? You guys go straight to Jesus.”\\r\\n In a Catholic school, I was given a laundry list of people to contact… before, the nuns said, because otherwise I’m bothering Jesus.\\r\\n “You are gonna call these people, Kathleen, before you bother Jesus. You could start with your guardian angel. He’s got nothing to do 24 hours a day except tend to your needs. If he’s not available, you can speak to the saint in charge of the activity you’re upset about. Every single saint has been assigned an assignment. You can speak to Jesus’ mother if you’d like to. You can give Mary a shout. But you are not to bother Jesus.”\\r\\n Okeydokey.\\r\\n Even if I did something bad, I couldn’t tell Jesus.\\r\\n I had to go to confession.\\r\\n I had to get in a creepy closet with a guy in the dark.\\r\\n And then I had to tell him, and he’s gonna tell a guy.\\r\\n And I wasn’t good at confession because my dad, for many years, was a defense attorney.\\r\\n And starting in second grade, he would tell us all at the dinner table, “I want all of you kids to remember if the police capture you or anyone in a position of authority ask you questions, your response, no matter what, are ‘I do not recall, I need an attorney. I do not recall, I need an attorney.’ Ninety percent of people are in prison because they can’t keep their goddamn mouths shut. Never, ever snitch on yourself.”\\r\\n And then I would go to confession in the closet, and the priest would go, “Kathleen, have you done anything bad?\\r\\n Is there anything you’d like to tell me about?”\\r\\n [Kathleen chuckles]\\r\\n I’m not falling for this. My dad’s probably planted him here.\\r\\n I know– I know what I’m supposed to say.\\r\\n “I’m sorry, Father, but I do not recall and I need an attorney.”\\r\\n “Honey, you’re only in second grade.”\\r\\n “Well, maybe you don’t know this, Father Anthony, but 90% of people are in prison because they can’t keep their goddamn mouths shut. If you’d like some more information on that–”\\r\\n If you’re from a big family, you know you never say anything directly to the sibling that you intend on saying something till you say it to a different sibling.\\r\\n They’ll say it to another, and then eventually it’ll get back to the sibling you intended it to say.\\r\\n I, uh–\\r\\n This year at Christmas, my brother said, “You should be on time because last year you were late.”\\r\\n And he said that our other sister said I ruined Christmas.\\r\\n I go, “Really? Did she say that? I ruined it? I’m calling her.”\\r\\n I go, “Did you say I ruined Christmas?”\\r\\n [scoffs] “Well, I might’ve. I mean, you were late. Everybody knew to get there at 9:30. You didn’t get there until 10:00. The kids were all excited. Everyone was excited. We had to wait ’cause you had to stop–”\\r\\n I go, “Okay, I agree. I was late. I apologize for that.\\r\\n But I would like to point out for the future that I think you and I have very different definitions of what ruining Christmas would be.”\\r\\n To me, ruining Christmas would be if I would’ve walked into Mom and Dad’s house with a 12-gauge shotgun and shot them in the face. I think that ruins Christmas. It ruins the rest of the Christmases after that, ’cause you can’t ever have another Christmas without going,\\r\\n “Oh, my God. Remember that one Christmas when Kathleen went crazy and shot Mom and Dad in the face? It was horrible.”\\r\\n My siblings have tons of kids. They’re everywhere.\\r\\n I don’t have any, and I’m glad I don’t.\\r\\n I don’t have the pressure of naming the kids. That’s awful.\\r\\n My youngest brother, his name is John Patrick Madigan.\\r\\n That’s my dad’s name, and that name has been in our family since 1853, circa Ireland, as far as we can count back.\\r\\n And then my youngest brother knew that they were having a boy, and he called and said, “You know what? I’m not gonna do it.”\\r\\n I go, “You’re not gonna name him John Patrick Madigan?”\\r\\n He goes, “No.”\\r\\n I go, “Well, I’ve never asked you for anything, but I would like to know when and where you’re going to be telling Dad this information, because I’m g',\n","  'onna bring a cooler of beer ’cause that’s how long his answer’s gonna be, Pat, and it’s gonna involve the whole history of Ireland and what’s wrong with English people and they were actually potatoes, but they never gave ’em to the people and Henry VIII. Wha– Why– Why would you pick this fight? Your name is John Patrick Madigan. We call you Patrick. His is John Patrick Madigan. We call him Jack. Grandpa was John Patrick Madigan. We call him– You can call him Fuck Nut. Just name him. This is a crazy fight, in my mind. Don’t– You’d have a better time telling Dad you’re gonna become a woman. Seriously. ’Cause Mom would smooth it over ’cause you’re the baby. Everyone in LA’s doing it. Bruce Jenner. Cher’s son.”\\r\\n I said, “Why? Why, Patrick? Why?”\\r\\n He goes, “You don’t know what it’s like to live with somebody else’s name. Exact same name.”\\r\\n He goes, “You know, I cannot get Direct TV because Dad won’t pay their bill.”\\r\\n What?\\r\\n I go, “They don’t even have Direct TV.”\\r\\n “Oh, no, not anymore. They did. Four years ago.”\\r\\n That’s how long the standoff’s been going on.\\r\\n It’s over a movie that Dad claims he didn’t rent.\\r\\n They’ve paid everything but that charge, but that charge has penalties.\\r\\n So it’s now $287.\\r\\n And I said, “Well, just pay the bill. I’ll pay it.”\\r\\n He goes, “No, I could pay it too. But I can’t pay it ’cause he won’t give me the account information. Because he doesn’t wanna pay it.”\\r\\n I go, “What was the movie, just out of curiosity?”\\r\\n He goes, “Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. And if you like to hear that speech, call him, Kathleen.”\\r\\n “Why would I rent Abraham Lincoln? Has something new happened? Do we have new information? Did John Wilkes Booth not shoot Abraham Lincoln? I never ordered goddamn Lincoln . I know it.”\\r\\n I said, “All right. Well, if you’re not gonna do that, what other names were you guys thinking of?”\\r\\n He goes, “Well, a lot. But here’s a little left-field one. Maybe Seamus.” And I went, “Seamus Madigan?”\\r\\n He goes, “Why is that funny to you?” I go, “I don’t know. But we should pay attention to that.”\\r\\n I just laughed for no reason.\\r\\n I go, “I think names have power. If you’re gonna name him Seamus Madigan, I think you should lower all expectations.”\\r\\n Seamus Madigan is a bartender.\\r\\n He always was a bartender. He will always be a bartender.\\r\\n I don’t think he’s gonna be a heart surgeon.\\r\\n And if he was, I wouldn’t let him operate on me, even if he was my nephew.\\r\\n If I was in some emergency room, they came out and said, “Your surgeon, Dr. Seamus Madigan, will be out in a minute,”\\r\\n I would be like, “No, he will not.”\\r\\n And I would wheel my ass down to the Jewish hospital, where there was a nice young man named Sam whose family took education more seriously than beer pong and football.\\r\\n That’s what I would do.\\r\\n I have no kids. I don’t– I don’t want them.\\r\\n I’ve seen what it’s done to some of my siblings.\\r\\n Oh, they’re so tired and cranky.\\r\\n My sister’s normally very happy. Has twins.\\r\\n She looks so tired. I go, “You look really tired.”\\r\\n “You don’t have to say that. I know I look tired. I am tired. I have four-year-olds. Did you know– I thought it was gonna get easier. It doesn’t. The average four-year-old asks 436 questions in a day. Did you know that? And I have two of ’em. And I’m too tired to add 436 plus 436. It’s a lot of questions, Kathleen.”\\r\\n I said, “Do you know why they ask 436? ’Cause you were dumb enough to answer the first question. That’s what led to that line of questioning. You got to shut it down.”\\r\\n If I have ’em, I’d throw ’em in the van in the morning.\\r\\n They’ll ask a random question.\\r\\n “Hey, Aunt Kat, how come their dog gets to be out front and ours doesn’t?”\\r\\n “Fuck if I know.” That’s the answer.\\r\\n Ask Siri. Siri has answers.\\r\\n Aunt Kat, no answers.\\r\\n [Kathleen chuckles]\\r\\n Here’s the biggest reason I would never wanna have a kid.\\r\\n ’Cause I will never again on my own or even assist on installing a car seat.\\r\\n I don’t know how many of you ever had ',\n","  'to do this, but if you’re gonna, here’s a few helpful hints.\\r\\n Take the whole day off work, because that’s how long it’s gonna take you.\\r\\n Whatever your favorite alcohol is, have a bucket of it next to that minivan, ’cause you’re gonna stop and have to take drinks and re-read things.\\r\\n If you’re over the age of, oh, I’d say 30, at some point you’re going to become infuriated with Ralph Nader, ’cause he’s the one who started it all.\\r\\n I remember being in grade school and he was on 60 Minutes .\\r\\n “Seat belts. Everybody must have a seat belt. Car seat, seat belts, safety is for life. Head injuries are also for life. I have statistics.”\\r\\n Well, maybe you do, Ralph.\\r\\n I’m sure you do. But so do I. There were seven of us, Ralph.\\r\\n For 16 years, we rode around in the back of a station wagon completely untethered.\\r\\n Completely.\\r\\n And we were in accidents. A lot of them. Especially if my mom was driving.\\r\\n We– Sometimes we got hit so hard, I actually flew to a better seat than I’d originally secured.\\r\\n “Who’s got the window now, jackass?”\\r\\n That’s right.\\r\\n And that was with my parents chain-smoking in the car. Both of ’em.\\r\\n It was so smoky in that car.\\r\\n You could barely see other passengers. Seriously.\\r\\n They way, way back was like Studio 54, because the sun would hit the smoke and create patterns, and then I would draw patterns within the pattern because I didn’t have an iPad, so that’s what I would do to entertain myself.\\r\\n If you’re a woman and you’re gonna install a car seat, I would highly suggest you put on a sports bra, ’cause you’re gonna get hot.\\r\\n You’re gonna be so hot, you’re gonna start inadvertently just tearing off pieces of clothing.\\r\\n And if you’re not careful, you’ll end up like I did, in my sister’s driveway in my regular bra just drinking a beer, staring off into space.\\r\\n And the normally, very friendly neighbors came home. I’m trying to talk to ’em.\\r\\n I don’t know why they’re being so weird.\\r\\n And I’m like, “How you guys doing? Yeah, I know. I just came home. She had twins. I need two of these. I can’t– can’t figure it out. I’m so hot. I’m so hot. I would offer you a beer, but I only have three left. And I’ve made no progress.”\\r\\n So–\\r\\n I just found notes on the back–\\r\\n There’s factory notes that say if you don’t know how to do this, you can take it to the police or the fire department and they’ll install it for you.\\r\\n But unfortunately, I didn’t find those notes till after I already started drinking.\\r\\n So I don’t think it would be a good idea to drive to law enforcement, shit-faced, and two car seats and I don’t have any babies.\\r\\n I mean, It’s just too much to explain, right?\\r\\n Crazy.\\r\\n So this was what I was thinking.\\r\\n I was thinking I might set her car on fire.\\r\\n No, call the fire department, and then after they put the car out, I go, “Hey, since you’re all here, do you think you can give me a hook-up?”\\r\\n [man] Yeah!\\r\\n [chuckles]\\r\\n They’re a pain in the ass, to put kids in them, especially in winter with the coats and 70,000 buckles and the whole thing.\\r\\n And my brother’s kid I thought was big enough to not go in a car seat, and I said, “Do I do him too?”\\r\\n She’s just disgusted with my lack of any parenting knowledge.\\r\\n She goes, “Ugh. 4-foot-10, 80 pounds.”\\r\\n What?\\r\\n “That’s a Missouri state law, Kathleen. If you’re 4-foot-10 or shorter, 80 pounds or less, your ass is in a car seat versus a ticket from the Missouri State Highway Patrol.”\\r\\n I go, “Really, 4’10”?\\r\\n That is excellent news because right now I’m only 5-foot-1.\\r\\n The average woman, due to osteoporosis… in your life, you would have shrunk anywhere from two to five inches.\\r\\n I am not certain. I am bad at math.\\r\\n But I’m pretty sure that puts me back in a car seat.\\r\\n I can’t wait to be back in a car seat.\\r\\n All these nieces and nephews I have will be old enough to drive.\\r\\n I’m gonna do exactly what they do. I’ll call and say I need a ride.\\r\\n Then I’m gonna pack a big bag full of unnecessary, unrelated items that I have to have',\n","  ', or there is going to be a meltdown.\\r\\n Then, like the five and six-year-olds, I’m gonna get in the van and walk, on my own accord, to the very backseat, and I’m just gonna hop up in it like they do and wait for the great buckling.\\r\\n Just sit there.\\r\\n [mouthing words]\\r\\n Then I’m gonna let ’em buckle me in. Then I’m gonna let them pull away.\\r\\n And I’m gonna wait till they drive where it’s somewhere terribly inconvenient to pull over.\\r\\n And I’m gonna start screaming from the back like they do.\\r\\n “My buckle’s too tight!”\\r\\n [gasping]\\r\\n “I’m choking!”\\r\\n [gasping]\\r\\n [chuckles]\\r\\n “I dropped my wine.”\\r\\n [gasping]\\r\\n “I can’t reach my wine.”\\r\\n [chuckling]\\r\\n That’s what I want to do when I’m retired.\\r\\n I just want to drink red wine and watch House Hunters over and over.\\r\\n I love that show. I do.\\r\\n I don’t know why. I don’t even care what houses these people are buying.\\r\\n I’m more interested in their relationships because at least 50 percent of the people shouldn’t even be married, more or less purchasing property together.\\r\\n I saw one in Atlanta.\\r\\n It was a man and a woman. They walked into the house.\\r\\n And the first thing out of the man’s mouth, he goes, “Ah! I can’t live with this backsplash.”\\r\\n Oh, my God, ma’am.\\r\\n You have a much bigger problem than what house you’re gonna buy.\\r\\n You have accidentally married a gay guy.\\r\\n And his boyfriend is not gonna approve of this ugly backsplash when he comes over here while you’re at yoga, aka drinking with your girlfriends on a Thursday.\\r\\n I’m just amazed to, like–\\r\\n In my whole life I’ve never punched anybody, but if I was the Realtors on this show, I would punch at least half of these people– my own clients right in the face.\\r\\n They are so demanding, and they naysay a house right out of the gate.\\r\\n They just walk in and go, “Pah! I can’t live here. There’s no granite countertops.”\\r\\n I’m sorry. Maybe you forgot. You have a budget of $8.00.\\r\\n Maybe… you should be grateful that I’m not showing you a mobile home right now and bragging about the porch that JoJo put on before he went back to prison.\\r\\n What in Christ’s name would make you think you can have granite countertops?\\r\\n And it’s always the meanest lady of any episode who at some point would go, “I don’t know if I want to live here. I don’t see any room for entertaining.”\\r\\n Well, don’t worry, ma’am. No one’s fucking coming over here.\\r\\n You’re the meanest person I’ve ever heard speak English on television.\\r\\n Seriously.\\r\\n But I think over the age of 40, if that’s what I wanna do with my time–\\r\\n Over 40 you can kind of give up.\\r\\n If I just want to drink wine, why not?\\r\\n The dream catcher didn’t catch anything.\\r\\n It’s the third quarter. I’m losing.\\r\\n Just– I do understand– Over 40– I don’t understand young people that kind of give up so early where you can tell they’re just disgusted.\\r\\n They don’t want any more information. They have just had it.\\r\\n Early, like in their 20s.\\r\\n I flew to Norfolk, Virginia. I’ve never been there.\\r\\n I got off the plane. And their airport was themed.\\r\\n I’ve never seen that. And the theme they chose was mermaids.\\r\\n They were everywhere.\\r\\n They were, like, in the carpet, in baggage claim.\\r\\n They’re handing you the luggage.\\r\\n They’re just everywhere.\\r\\n And I went to the gift shop on the way out because I wanted to get water.\\r\\n There’s a girl working in the gift shop. She’s about 25 years old.\\r\\n I said, “Hey, I’m not from here. What’s going on with all this mermaid stuff?”\\r\\n And she said, and I quote, [raspy voice] “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.”\\r\\n Wow. Wow. I thought, she truly doesn’t give a shit.\\r\\n She– Bigfoot could’ve been shopping in that gift shop.\\r\\n She’d be like, “I don’t know what your hairy ass is planning on buying, but I close in five minutes, all right? I ain’t scared of you, Mr. Monster Man.”\\r\\n “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.”\\r\\n Just so disgusted that I even asked.\\r\\n But then after meeting the mermaid lady, for, like, the next three months no matter what question I w',\n","  'as asked, that’s the only answer I would give.\\r\\n I’ll just go, “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.”\\r\\n Because it is so confusing and dismissive to the recipient, but it’s so fun if you’re the one saying it.\\r\\n My– My youngest brother, the one who won’t let me speak about Malaysian Flight 370, he helps me with my taxes ’cause if I–\\r\\n Any state you work in you have to fill out their forms even if you don’t get money back.\\r\\n He called about six weeks after I’ve met the mermaid lady, and he goes, “Yeah, Kathleen, I’m trying to do your taxes.\\r\\n I’m trying to get all these states. I think you worked in Wisconsin two times.\\r\\n You should get– They have a state-withholding tax.\\r\\n You’ll be able to get a refund. It’s a 3.8 percent.\\r\\n Ah, da, da. When you got paid, you should’ve been given some forms.\\r\\n Do you know where those forms are?”\\r\\n “I don’t know. Somebody saw one once.”\\r\\n And I guarantee you, if you say that, the only thing a person will ever say back is, “What?”\\r\\n And then– [mouthing words]\\r\\n That’s what I wanna do. I wanna drink red wine and watch House Hunters .\\r\\n Uh, I don’t usually think I drink too much until you go to the doctor and they have those drinking questions on there.\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n Mine, it’s seven and eight.\\r\\n Question 7: Do you drink alcohol? A little tiny box says, “Yes.”\\r\\n Question 8: Do you drink two, four, six or eight drinks a week?\\r\\n “No.” [laughs]\\r\\n No.\\r\\n You are not even in the right ballpark. Jesus Christ.\\r\\n What is this, a Mormon practice?\\r\\n I thought the name said “Fitzgerald.”\\r\\n And I would not be judged on my deviant and abhorring drinking behavior.\\r\\n See other side, parenthesis, arrow.\\r\\n No.\\r\\n If I do feel bad about my drinking, I would come here.\\r\\n ’Cause you guys set a whole new bar.\\r\\n [audience cheering]\\r\\n Uh, or I go to Ireland.\\r\\n I try to go once a year to be with my people.\\r\\n To reset my priorities and my boundaries.\\r\\n I have friends that go to Hawaii every year.\\r\\n They’re like, “We love Hawaii, but you seem to really love Ireland.\\r\\n Do you think we would like it? Do you think they’re similar?”\\r\\n Oh. [scoffs]\\r\\n Well, they’re both an island.\\r\\n Um, Ireland, however, would have no vegetables or sun.\\r\\n I don’t know if those two things interest you, but they are fresh out.\\r\\n It is not a healthy place.\\r\\n That’s why I feel at home there, and that’s why I like it there.\\r\\n It’s sort of the gist. They just don’t really, truly give a shit.\\r\\n On a good level, in a healthy way, they’ve decided to not be healthy.\\r\\n I was in a pub. I ordered roast beef with mashed potatoes, ’cause I love that, and I thought, I’m going to ask, probably the answer is no, but I–\\r\\n The guy was like 80, the bartender.\\r\\n And I go, “Hey, do you guys, by any chance, have any corn?”\\r\\n You would’ve thought I asked for an eight-ball of cocaine.\\r\\n I–\\r\\n He goes, “Corn?”\\r\\n [Irish accent] “No, we wouldn’t have any corn here in the countryside. We probably don’t have any corn in the entire country at the moment.”\\r\\n I said, “Have you ever had corn?”\\r\\n “Yes. I’ve had corn. When I was nine, we traveled to Germany. And I had some corn and I didn’t care for it.”\\r\\n I was like, “Good for you.” He hasn’t had corn in 71 years. And he doesn’t give a shit. And he looks fine. And he’s bartending on a Thursday.\\r\\n The whole pace of Ireland is just slower. But I like it better.\\r\\n It just takes you a while in your American mind to slow down like that.\\r\\n I went– ’Cause they don’t–\\r\\n It’s very– Nobody’s really, you know, fired up on it.\\r\\n I went in a store that said “bagels,” in a little town in the country.\\r\\n I walked in. There’s a lady.\\r\\n And there’s a glass case, and there’s no bagels.\\r\\n And I thought, here we go. Right?\\r\\n I go, “You don’t have any–”\\r\\n I thought maybe they were in the back. “You don’t have any bagels?”\\r\\n “No, I’m afraid we wouldn’t have any bagels at the moment.”\\r\\n “Are you selling any other food right now?”\\r\\n “No. I wouldn’t be selling anything but the bagels, and I don’t have at the moment.”\\r\\n It’s at that point ',\n","  'your American brain wants to go, “What the fuck is wrong with you people?”\\r\\n But I would never do that ’cause I’m Midwest polite.\\r\\n I– I said, “Uh, what– Can I ask you a question? Why are you still open? ’Cause you have nothing for sale.”\\r\\n She goes, “I left the door open. First of all, I don’t know where the bagels are. They’re supposed to be here half past 7:00. It’s half past 10:00. I don’t know. Perhaps there’s been an accident on the road. You’ll say a rosary or perhaps a novena tonight for Johnny the bagel man. I left the door open in case I had a nice conversation with someone like yourself.”\\r\\n Oh, my God. I have to now go back to the other bar and order a Guinness in order to fix this conversation in my brain.\\r\\n I love Guinness. That is actually my favorite thing in the whole world.\\r\\n It’s the greatest drink.\\r\\n It’s like somebody had a beer, and then somebody threw a roast beef in the beer, and then somebody put mashed potatoes on top and handed it to you.\\r\\n [man] Whoo!\\r\\n It’s not healthy. But I really don’t care about health either.\\r\\n There comes a point in your life where you’re like, “I think it’s too late.”\\r\\n That’s why I don’t like to watch CNN because Sanjay Gupta, that doctor, comes on, and he is a buzzkill.\\r\\n Every single time he’s on, he’s got bad news about things that can kill us.\\r\\n But it’s things we’ve been doing our whole lives.\\r\\n I’m like, “Sanjay, people watching CNN are most likely over the age of 30. It is too late for us. You, sir, should be on Nickelodeon. Tell the children. Save the children.”\\r\\n It’s too late.\\r\\n I was watching it about two weeks before Thanksgiving.\\r\\n He came on. He’s like, “Uh-oh. Oh, God.\\r\\n Horrible news. Uh, World Health Organization just did a study.\\r\\n And as it turns out, they have decided that processed meats are raising the cancer rates by a much higher rate, specifically bacon.”\\r\\n [audience jeering]\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n Yeah, well, that’s right, Wisconsin.\\r\\n That’s– [chuckles] Whoa.\\r\\n I’m like, bacon?\\r\\n I’m sorry to hear that, Sanjay.\\r\\n ’Cause I love bacon. I’ve been eating it my whole life.\\r\\n Sometimes I put it in Bloody Marys. I’ve actually drank bacon.\\r\\n That’s how much–\\r\\n I added it up.\\r\\n In my life, give or take ten, I have eaten 311 pigs.\\r\\n I– I’ve eaten a farm, sir.\\r\\n You can’t fix that with a yoga class.\\r\\n You can’t back that damage up with a walk around the block.\\r\\n And I don’t even go looking for health stuff.\\r\\n I’m not that person where– No. Like the front page of Yahoo.\\r\\n I don’t know. Six months ago it said, “If you’re fair skin with freckles, uh, click here.”\\r\\n Why, I don’t want to click it.\\r\\n You know it’s not good news.\\r\\n They’re not gonna go, “Hey, guess what, freckle people. Y’all won $50. Run on down to the post office and pick up your government check.”\\r\\n No.\\r\\n But I feel like I have to click on it, ’cause it’s a meeting of my people.\\r\\n What if there’s an announcement and I don’t hear it, and I’m the only lady that didn’t know.\\r\\n Look like some sort of jackass.\\r\\n So I clicked on it.\\r\\n Google this. It’s unbelievable.\\r\\n They go, “Uh-oh. Pah, just found this out.”\\r\\n Incoming. Breaking news.\\r\\n If you’re white with freckles, fair skin, and you’ve been drinking orange juice–\\r\\n All of us, our whole lives– or eating grapefruit, they have figured out that when you go outside in the sun, because your skin–\\r\\n It’s so easy to penetrate your skin, that the sun is activating the acid from the grapefruits and the oranges, raising your chances of melanoma by, like, 27 percent.\\r\\n Yeah. So now, I can’t go outside to exercise in the sunshine.\\r\\n Or I will become activated which forces me back into the dark bar… where I can have a Bloody Mary with some bacon in it.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n [man] yeah!\\r\\n And I said to my sister, “I would– I would exercise more.\\r\\n But all I do is fly around. I’m just sitting in an airport.”\\r\\n She goes, “You should get a Fitbit.” This is what this is on my arm.\\r\\n It would work better if I charged it properly.\\r\\n But this counts your steps an',\n","  'd your miles.\\r\\n And it’ll have your heart rate if you want to enter your food.\\r\\n It’s like this– I go, “Well, maybe I’ll do that. Maybe I’ll get addicted to seeing how many steps I get in a day.”\\r\\n So, from my iPad, on my couch, I ordered the Fitbit from Amazon.\\r\\n I paid the extra money to have it overnighted.\\r\\n So the following day, this was on my porch on my front steps, which I now know is six and a half steps away from my couch.\\r\\n And then I opened it up, and I googled it, ’cause I wanted to know how it work.\\r\\n Really? It can count how far I’ve walked, steps and speed.\\r\\n We can’t find Flight 370, but I’m not supposed to talk about that.\\r\\n Supposed to just let that go.\\r\\n But we have this technology.\\r\\n So I googled, “How does it work?”\\r\\n It works based on this motion from when you’re walking.\\r\\n And then, my Irish jackasses kicked in and I thought, but does it know if my whole body is moving?\\r\\n What if I had a glass of wine and I was going like that?\\r\\n Would it know?\\r\\n The answer is no. It does not know.\\r\\n I drank two and a half miles while watching the last–\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Thank you.\\r\\n Two and a half miles while watching the last Republican debate.\\r\\n I know I won’t vote for any politician who says this, uh, at anytime.\\r\\n If they say it. So far four of them have said it.\\r\\n It’s like a hack line they say on the campaign trail.\\r\\n I just find it so cheesy.\\r\\n They’ll go, “People, America is a place where your dreams can come true. I’m here to make your dreams come true. Wouldn’t you like your dreams to come true?”\\r\\n I’m sitting there thinking, “No. No, I don’t.”\\r\\n And the fact that you said that makes me certain you have never drank a box of wine and taken an Ambien.\\r\\n I do not want my dreams to come true.\\r\\n It was horrifying. I did it like six weeks ago.\\r\\n Here was the dream. This is the whole dream.\\r\\n I’m in Alaska, wearing a sombrero.\\r\\n It’s raining Cheetos, but I can’t move my arms.\\r\\n [groaning]\\r\\n Three and a half hours of that. No thanks.\\r\\n And then I turned on late-night TV, and that’s all the infomercials.\\r\\n And there it was, the Sarah McLachlan sad animal commercial.\\r\\n [audience groans]\\r\\n Exactly. I feel the same way.\\r\\n But I’ve seen it like 200 times.\\r\\n And do you know what I’ve done? Honestly?\\r\\n Nothing. And that’s not nice. But that’s the truth.\\r\\n I thought, why don’t I react to this?\\r\\n I can’t get an animal. I’m gone too much, but I could send the money.\\r\\n I think they say like 62 cents a day for the dog or the cat, right?\\r\\n But then I thought, “Well, I don’t know what’s going on there, Sarah, but that kid on the other channel is only 55 cents a day. So maybe your cat’s living a little large, Sarah. Or maybe the child needs a raise. I don’t know, but someone should check that before you start throwing figures like that out at night, late night when all the infomercials are on in a row.”\\r\\n And I thought, this ad doesn’t work on me because it’s so sad, I usually turn it off.\\r\\n Like, you can’t motivate people to action through the emotion of sadness.\\r\\n You need to make people angry or shocked or appalled.\\r\\n That’s what gets people of their ass.\\r\\n You don’t ever see a protest with a bunch of people just laying around crying.\\r\\n No. That’s not going to happen.\\r\\n And I thought, they need to redo this commercial to make a lot more money for the animals.\\r\\n I– This is what I’m doing late night after my Ambien and boxed wine.\\r\\n I’m thinking of how to fix the commercial.\\r\\n And I– I would call Sarah back. She seems like a lovely lady.\\r\\n Call her up in Canada and go, “We really messed up. We need you back down here, and we’re going to reshoot the commercial.”\\r\\n You pay for her to come back to America.\\r\\n You go, “Here’s what’s gonna– Here’s how it’s going to work, Sarah. We’re going to send you out to that song that you wrote, the saddest song ever written on earth.”\\r\\n ♪ In the arms ♪\\r\\n [yowling] I don’t know what the words are.\\r\\n I think it’s about that cat having pink eye, but I can’t–\\r\\n I don’t know. That',\n","  ' one definitely has pink eye.\\r\\n It’s dangerous ’cause it’s gonna hop to the other eye like Bob Costas at the Olympics.\\r\\n It’s– It’s a mess.\\r\\n You got to put hot water on it. And cats don’t like water.\\r\\n I don’t know how you would begin to fix that.\\r\\n But here’s what’s gonna happen, Sarah.\\r\\n You’re gonna walk out to that song that you wrote. Lovely song.\\r\\n And in one hand, you’re going to be holding a beagle puppy.\\r\\n And in the other hand, you’re going to be holding a pistol.\\r\\n Remember, this is for the animals. Stay with me.\\r\\n And then I’m going to need you, Sarah, to say in your oh-so-angelic voice, without laughing–\\r\\n You have to be serious.\\r\\n She’ll go, “Hello. I’m Sarah McLachlan. If someone doesn’t come down here… in the next 45 minutes, I’m gonna blow this beagle’s brains out.”\\r\\n I would be horrified.\\r\\n I’d be like, “Can you Shazam her location? Where is she?”\\r\\n And I would drive down there, and I would take the puppy and kick the gun out of her hand.\\r\\n And where did you even get a gun? You’re Canadian.\\r\\n You’re allowed one bear gun per family, Sarah.\\r\\n That is not a bear gun.\\r\\n You guys have been a lot of fun. If you drank and you’re gonna drive, focus.\\r\\n Don’t be playing with your phone.\\r\\n I am not advocating drinking and driving.\\r\\n I’m not.\\r\\n Drinking and driving is really bad.\\r\\n And it’s really bad– I never thought about this.\\r\\n But I have a friend, who told me to say was a very handsome friend, Rick in Denver, he got a DUI.\\r\\n I never thought about this until he told me what happens.\\r\\n Now when you get taken to jail, they take all your stuff.\\r\\n That includes your phone. And they lock it all in a drawer.\\r\\n Then they come back to your cell and tell you you’re now allowed to make one phone call.\\r\\n [blows air]\\r\\n Well, that’s the problem.\\r\\n ’Cause you just locked my brain in a drawer.\\r\\n I don’t know anybody’s phone numbers by heart anymore.\\r\\n Seriously, I don’t.\\r\\n I don’t know what I– What– What would you do?\\r\\n I know the number of the house I grew up in.\\r\\n I could call that family… and hope that they were really nice people.\\r\\n “Don’t hang up. Don’t hang up. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I’m in so much trouble. I know you guys are kind of busy in Ferguson. Do you have $2,800?”\\r\\n Then I thought, seriously? They wouldn’t let you look at your phone?\\r\\n He goes, “Kathleen, you don’t get it. No, no.”\\r\\n I go, “I think that’s being stringent. You’re not a murderer. You’re not a rapist. You’re Drunky the Clown. You’ve been captured. You can’t hurt anybody. They wouldn’t even show you your contacts?”\\r\\n “No.”\\r\\n I thought, especially if I had been drinking, that’s when my jackass behavior would kick in.\\r\\n And I would say, “Okay, I’m ready for my call.”\\r\\n I let them bring me the phone, and my one call, I would call 911 from the cell.\\r\\n [chuckling]\\r\\n “Hello. Oh, yes, this is absolutely an emergency.”\\r\\n [blows air] “Well, I have been kidnapped. That’s what’s going on here. I was abducted by two men in matching outfits. And I was thrown into what I can only surmise right now is some sort of sex dungeon.”\\r\\n [chuckling]\\r\\n “No, I’m not laughing. No, I’m not laughing. My location? Well, that actually is kind of funny. If– If you would just glance down the hall. Ha ha!”\\r\\n All right, you guys, thank you so much. I’ve had a great time. Thank you for coming out.

It’s good. It’s really good. Nobody gets pregnant. It’s a lot of fun.\\r\\n I’m trying to learn things about myself. Um, I got a scale for my bathroom. I’m not trying to lose weight, I’m just interested in the data. [Laughter] And I did learn something, I learned this… Because I weigh myself every night before I go to bed; and then I also weigh myself on the morning when I get up and I… Here’s what I learned… I weigh two pounds less every morning than when I went to bed… And I found out why, it’s because I shit in my bed every night. [Laughter] I do… I take a full two-pound dump in bed, and then I turn out the lights and I go to sleep. Because I don’t want to sleep alone. Your needs change when you get older… At my age, a big… big pile of shit’s as good as anybody.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n I actually have a girlfriend, but we’re struggling, because she lives in France, uh, she’s French, she lives all the way over there, and we haven’t been able to see each other for a year because of the disease. I have AIDS. And, uh… [Laughter] She’s great, though, she sends me presents all the time. That’s how she keeps it going. She sends me gifts in the mail. I get something from her every week. Sometimes it’s chocolate from France or a shirt she wishes I would wear instead of things like this. And sometimes she sends something to make fun of me because she’s a little fucked up, so last time she sent me a pair of little girl’s panties. And, uh… yeah, I was like, “That’s not funny,” because these are in my house now. I can’t get rid of ’em! It’s like nuclear waste! Think of it, I can’t throw them out because I can’t have people find little girl’s panties in my garbage with coffee grounds and butter on ’em.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n And every solution I think of makes it worse, like, if I… If I put ’em in a bag inside another bag and… Layers of duct tape, wrapped in tinfoil. Or if I put him in a coffee can and I nail it shut and I bury it in the park in the middle of the night. Or if I cut ’em into tiny pieces… and throw away one piece each week in a different to',\n","  'wn. My friend tried to help me, he’s like, “Why don’t you just burn them?” I’m like, Do you understand? Even if there’s a one-in-a-million chance I get caught burning little girl’s panties… [Laughter] So I’m wearing them right now. So…\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Yep… it’s the only solution I could come up with, I wear ’em every day… And I hand-wash them. And then I dry them like this… [Blowing] Just right on the little strawberries.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Here’s the thing: men… our biggest fear in life is that we’re going to get caught being a kid f*cker, that’s every guy’s biggest fear. Even if you would never do it, every guy’s like, “That’s what’s going to happen to me, I know it.” It’s like being afraid of sharks when you live in the desert, like, “I don’t go to the ocean, but it’s going to happen.” ‘Cause it’s a fear not based in its likelihood, but in how horrible it would be if it happened. Because when they catch a pedophile, holy fuck. Holy shit! It’s brutal… Because we’re scared, we’re so scared of pedophilia because it’s here and it’s not going anywhere. That’s a fact… it’s not like there’s a finite amount of pedophiles, and, “We got the last one!” No, they keep… It keeps happening; every generation, there’s more. Some of you have kids and some of them are going to grow up, and f*ck kids, they might, you know? Okay, no, I’m… of course… Of course not yours, for some reason, but… [Laughter] They’re coming from some place. So any real solution has to start with the basic reality that there will always be pedophiles. Not a great thought, I understand, it’s not an uplifting… You wouldn’t put that on a fridge magnet. [Laughter] Or on your screensaver at the office. “There will always be pedophiles.” “Hey, where’s Jim? He’s not at his desk.”\\r\\n We do… we have to start with that reality, because our solutions that we have so far don’t really work. Here is our current solution to pedophilia: We wait till somebody fucks about 10,000 kids, and then we go, “All right, you, you better cut that out.” That’s pretty much it. There is no measures for preventing it. None! We have no policy to prevent it pe… No, we’re not even just… Like a street sign. There’s a street sign for everything! “No hunting,” “no spitting,” “no skateboarding.” I’ve never seen a “Don’t f*ck a child” sign in the w… I’ve been all over the world! Not even just like a picture of a guy f*cking a kid with a line through it, so that it… transcends language barriers. I mean, try it! You won’t get most of them with the sign. But even if one out of 50 of them is like, “Oh, shit, I’m sorry, I didn’t know it was an issue,” that’s money well spent!\\r\\n There’s things that might work, and we don’t even try them. Like, is anybody working on very realistic child sex dolls? Okay, then let ’em f*ck your kids forever, is th… if that’s better! I’m so sorry… for suggesting something that might actually work. “Oh, no! Let ’em f*ck both my sons, but don’t make a doll. That would be distasteful.” The thing is that this… I’m still talking about it… This… this pro',\n","  'blem… We lose things because we won’t really face it, you know, that are important us, like the Boy Scouts. Boy Scouts… wonderful thing, being sued out of existence ’cause of all the kid fuckery that goes on. And I know it’s upsetting, because, look, here’s the thing: the Boy Scouts is a wonderful thing for kids. They go to the woods, they work together, they learn skills, they get in touch with nature. What could it be better for a boy than that? But some of those guys want to fuck the kids. I don’t think they do it a lot. It’s not like there’s just a shit-load of kids being fucked in the Boy Scouts; I think it’s mostly that they find out that the guy wants to… I don’t actually know, though. I don’t. Do you know why I don’t know? Because I’m afraid to look it up! I’ll go to prison for typing it into a Google! How do you solve a problem if you’re afraid to fucking look it up? “How many Boy Scouts get fucked on a…” [Imitating alarm blaring] “Oh, shit!”\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Every time I move, I’ve got to tell my neighbors that I looked that up. Here’s what happens… Every few years you find out there’s some pedophile-type people in the Boy Scouts and then they announce, “We got… we got ’em all, we’re good.” And then a year later, “Whoa, there’s a bunch more!” [Harrumphs] “What’s going on here?!”\\r\\n At some point, you’ve got to wake up to the basic fact that the… maybe the people who are best suited to give your kids these wonderful experiences are folks that want to f*ck them. Maybe that’s… Maybe that’s why they’re good at it. Maybe that’s… if you want that, that’s where you go. Maybe that’s just the way that goes. Who else would want to take a bunch of kids to the fucking woods?! Who wants to take your shit kid to the fucking woods?! You don’t want to take ’em! Who else would want to do that, except people that are barely containing that they want to f*ck every kid in the face? That’s why they’re good at it. That’s what makes them good at it.\\r\\n I’m not saying that all Scoutmasters are pedophiles. I might be saying that the best ones are. I might be saying that. That sounds right. So I don’t know… you have to lose the whole thing? Just tell your kids, “Some of those guys want to f*ck you, just be careful, have a good time.”\\r\\n Take the contribution from where it comes. Michael Jackson… Wonderful music, blessed us with wonderful music… Did some other things, too. What… look, what’s worse: a pedophile who makes beautiful music, or one that doesn’t? This is the choices. “No pedophiles” is not on the menu.\\r\\n So how’ve you all been enjoying living the way I already was for a couple of years before all this shit?\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Welcome to my life. Can’t work, can’t go outside, can’t show your face, gotta wash your groceries. [Laughter] ‘Cause I got cum on the groceries. That’s why I just… in my mind, that’s what it means. Maybe that’s not what you’re thinking, but…\\r\\n I have a solution for the pandemic, by the way, for COVID, I have it. This is it: We test everybody, first of all, and ever',\n","  'y time we find somebody who has COVID, you kill them. That’s it. That’s the solution. You won’t need another one after that one. That’s the final one.\\r\\n It’s been pretty amazing to be alive during this thing, during COVID, because you’re not going to see this again, and, wow, did we learn some shit. That’s really… the things that teach you in life are things you never would have chosen to do for yourself. I mean, think about your life as far as it’s been, where you had the choices, where you’re like, “I’m going to do this, I’m going to pursue this.” It all goes to shit, every bit of it. And even when it goes right, you’re like, “Why don’t I like it? It’s what I wanted. But why don’t I like it?!” Because it’s your choice and your choices are based on fear and fucking just thin, stupid, shitty hopes. But when life just kicks you in the balls and you’re like, “Oh, fuck, everything’s different now,” and you… It shows you shit you wouldn’t have looked at otherwise. That’s the great joy in it.\\r\\n And what I thought was really interesting about COVID, and still is, is that it’s the first thing I’ve seen where everyone on Earth had the same problem. Every human being on Earth had the same problem, and we never had that before. That’s why we don’t give a shit about each other, because you read, like, “Oh, there’s floods in Houston,” you’re like, “It’s fucking water!” What is it? What’s your problem? Floods… What does that? Just walk like this. What’s… what, you can’t handle some water? My basement floods… What the fuck? Who gives a shit? Like, he’s on a canoe in the street… “That looks like fun. Why is that an issue?” There’s fires in California. What… [Blows] Blow it out. What, you can’t fucking blow out a fire? Get the water from Houston and dump it on California. Fuckin’ deal with it.\\r\\n But we all had the same problem, every person from Zimbabwe to Tokyo to Newark to Honolulu, everybody was doing the same dumb shit. Every person had the same stupid fucking moment at the same… just trying to get the mask out of the well of your car door, trying to… “I got to go in Walgreen’s, where’s my fucking mask?” You try to… It’s got pistachio shells in it and pennies. Shake it… “I’m sure it’s still effective.”\\r\\n I actually like the masks, ’cause it just… Everybody looked nice. Everybody did, ’cause it’s just their eyes. Eyes are nice. You never hear somebody say, “That guy’s got gross eyes.” It’s really… we should hide these, we should keep the masks, because this is disgusting, how do we just… With no shame, “Look inside my face! Ha-ha-ha!” Spit and tongue and teeth? It’s fucking gross! Cover your mouth! Don’t…\\r\\n I’d rather look at your asshole than your mouth. I really would, I’d rather stare into your asshole than glance at your mouth. Assholes aren’t that bad, not to look at. We don’t like to think about assholes, ’cause, like, you know, the shit and the farts and the diarrhea. But that’s a small portion of their time. You ever really look at an ass… You ever really look? [Laughter] [Blowing] Mmm. Once you see i',\n","  't, like in nature, it’s just… it’s a little… [Squeaks] That’s all. That’s your asshole. It’s like… You know what it is? It’s just an aperture, that’s all it is. That’s your asshole. It’s like a camera shutter, that’s all it is. It’s like the opening to the James Bond movies, That’s what your asshole’s… [Imitating James Bond theme] [Laughter] [Imitates gunshot, flatulence]\\r\\n You ever go to lick somebody’s asshole and there’s a little guy with a gun in there? [Laughter] It was bad.\\r\\n But it really was an interesting social experiment, COVID, because everybody got told the same thing… The whole world got told the same thing. If you go out unnecessarily, millions will die. And a lot of us said, “Oh, I’m going out.” [Laughter] “Yeah… I’m going now and a lot.” Yeah, and millions died. Just, we’re not that different from the turtles that you’re trying to get them not to cross the fucking highway and they’re like this, “Where I fuck, I fucked over there, fuck you.” And we’re like, “Please stop!” Putting little signs up… “Don’t go!” And he’s, “Fuck you. I’m a turtle…” [Imitates splatting] It doesn’t… We’re not that different. We’re just a fuckin’ species, and we’re just rolling along. Yeah, many dying old ladies died. That’s what happened. Many dying old ladies finished dying.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Here’s the way you got to look at it, okay? We’re still making more. We’re making new old ladies. Every day. There’s a fresh batch coming, they’re going to be great.\\r\\n I was having sex with a woman once, and she was so beautiful, I was having trouble not cumming, so I pictured her face at 80 years old, and then I came immediately. [Laughter] Because she was 92.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Anyway… One thing I found very interesting was that during the pandemic, a lot of people really liked counting the dead people. That got very popular, was counting the amount of the dead and dying. “Do you know how many people… Just today! Just today! Do you know how many people died of COVID-19?!” “Just today!”\\r\\n When… why… wh… Keeping a daily tally? We don’t do this… A lot of shit going on that we don’t keep a daily tally of how many… babies were dropped in a bucket of paint. And I looked that up! I’m not kidding you. It’s 30 a day, it’s a real problem. I’m serious! A steady 30 babies a day are dropped in buckets of paint. It’s not random, it’s one guy that won’t stop doing it.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Yeah, we liked counting them, we liked counting the dead. And when it got really high, we didn’t know how to count them anymore, people trying to find different ways to express the number or take it in. Remember January? It was really b… It was 3,000 people every day were dying of COVID, so people started saying this… “This is 9-11 every day.” “This is literally 9-11 every day.” When did we start measuring deaths in “9-11s”? When did that become the new, “how many football fields long is it,” for mass death? “How many 9-11s was World War II? Can we look it up?” I know the Holocaust was 2,000 9-11s. 9-11 wasn’t that bad, it was just one.\\r\\n [Laughter and appl',\n","  \"ause]\\r\\n Only one 9-11 of people died on 9-11. That’s like nobody died that day.\\r\\n See, it’s all relative, because then you have those… Later… remember, January was really bad, January was the worst, and then in April, March/April, we all felt better, everybody’s like, “Oh, it’s way better now, it’s way better, “way better than January”… I looked it up, it was 1,500 people a day… and everybody’s like, “It’s way better than January.” Really?! It’s half a 9-11 every single day. But that’s way better. That would be like if on 9-11, after the first tower went down, you’re like, “Eh, that’s not that bad…” It’s just one. “Still got the other one, that’s why they made two.” It’s okay, it’s all right to… make fun of 9-11, it was a hoax. Uh…\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n All right. Sorry. Anyway…\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n I thought I had COVID about three times, I’m one of those idiots, I was like, “I think I have it. Can you feel?”\\r\\n I’m bad with pain too, like, the other day I hit my elbow right on that spot where if I had a gun, I’d be dead now, you know, that s… I can’t do pain. That’s why I could never be a cop. I couldn’t walk around with a gun right here. There’s 50 things a day where I’d be like, “Fuck that, that ain’t worth…” That’s my main problem, by the way, with the whole “defund the police” idea: What about people who want to commit suicide by cop? What about them? Anyway, we’ll put a pin in that, but…\\r\\n We had a lot of protests in New York, and now we have protesters that just live here. They’re not at a protest, they’re just here. I saw a protester in Washington Square Park. She had green hair and dirty legs. And she’s holding a little piece of cardboard, and it’s… with a Sharpie… It said “Abolish billionaires.” She’s standing there. And I thought, “I don’t think that’s going to do it. I don’t…” It doesn’t feel like that’s going to result… “in Jeff Bezos going, ‘What’s happening to me?'” [Laughter] Sadly, it’s going to be okay for him.\\r\\n I think that… I thought it was good how p… How young people got out there and they expressed themselves, they went out there to solve a lot of problems. Not all the problems, but some of them. They went out there to stop discrimination. Uh, not all discrimination. Just some of it, which is a weird form of discrimination. But there are groups… There are groups that are discriminated against, the… who don’t have any protesters or any people working for them. And we all discriminate against these people, like ugly people. Everybody discriminates against ugly people. They do, and it’s awful… I mean, I’d rather be discriminated against for my race than for being ugly because you might not lose a job or a promotion, but nobody kisses you on the lips, like, your whole fucking life, like, try that. This is what we say to ugly people… “We don’t like your face. Just don’t like it. So no one’s going to fall in love with you, and it’s unanimous… sorry.” And we just expect ugly people to be like, “Oh, no, I understand. I mean, sure, my head shape is no good \",\n","  'for you, so I’ll… I’ll with… I’ll go without the things that matter in life.”\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Also, overweight people… Overweight people deal with things that none of us deal with… Because I’m not overweight. There’s people… [Laughter] Who are discriminated against because of their weight. I read a story once about a woman who was 600 pounds and she couldn’t get medical care, because everything… She goes to the doctor, he just says it’s because she’s fat… everything. She’s like, “My knees hurt,” he’s like, “Yeah, my knees hurt just looking at you, what’d you think was going to happen?” She’s like, “I have chest pains,” he says, “Yeah, ’cause your organs are over capacity, so they are hurting.” She’s like, “I got shot in the head,” he’s like, “Yeah, because you’re fucking fat, somebody shot you in the fucking head ’cause you’re fat.”\\r\\n It’s a terrible story. Here’s the worst part of the story, and this is true, this is true: she needed an MRI because she had something serious; she’s 600 pounds, she doesn’t fit in the machine. Do you know what they did? They sent her to the zoo. I’m not kidding, they sent her to the fuckin’ zoo! That’s what we do for fat people… who need an MRI! “Hey, here’s your prescription… go to the zoo.” Yeah, that’s where you should go. “You should go to the zoo.”\\r\\n By the way, you know how many fat people we have in this country? About 600 trillion-billion- thousands of ’em! You know how many trans people there are? About 38. But if you’re trans and you need a restroom and it’s awkward, we’ll change every restroom! But if you’re fat and you need an MRI, you go to the zoo, you fat b*tch. Just go to the zoo. You go experience that today.\\r\\n What happens when she gets to the zoo? What actually fucking happens when she arrives at the zoo?! “Hi… Are you here to see the monkeys?” “No, I’m here for an MRI.” “Oh, shit. All right. Yeah.” Uh-Huh. Okay, just stand in the straw over here. “Yeah, you’re after the walrus who has lymphoma.”\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n By the way, why is there an MRI machine at the fuckin’ zoo?! Who was it developing that instead of a fat-human-being MRI? Who’s paying for this shit? You don’t give an elephant a fucking magnetic resonance image test! Are you fuckin’ high? That’s obscene! If an elephant is sick, you just listen. You do this thing. “Me-sa thinks she gonna die today.”\\r\\n I’m saying this out of respect for elephants, by the way, because we’re supposed to respect how they live. They don’t fucking cure their diseases. This is not their culture, this is our weird… “Let’s fix it! Oh, he’s sick!” That’s not how elephants live! An elephant in the Serengeti isn’t like, “I have a lump, I have to see my oncologist.” When an elephant gets cancer, he falls over and takes his fuckin’ turn and becomes food. You don’t put an elephant in a state-of-the-art… [Imitates beeping] What if you find cancer? What, are you going to give them chemotherapy? Think a skinny elephant with a pink baseball hat.\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n [Labored breathing] “Each day is a gift.”\\r\\n [Laughter]',\n","  '\\r\\n I love animals, I do… I do. We have a weird relationship to animals… We name them and we play with them, and we kill them and we eat them, and we stuff them. And we draw them. I have a dog… I love my dog, but I don’t know my dog. We’ve never had a conversation, not one time. I talk and she just hears… [Gibberish] [Gibberish] She looks at me, I’m like, “Yes!” She’s like, “What, you don’t know what the fuck I’m think…” “Fuck you”…\\r\\n I don’t know this bitch, I have no idea what she’s thinking. I really wish I did, I wish I knew what she was thinking, it’s my biggest wish, maybe, in life, is that I knew, ’cause I know she has thoughts. I know she does. There’s no way she’s just like, “Dog.” There’s stuff going on in here. I’ve seen it. You ever watch your dog make a decision? You ever d… watch your dog just walk in the room and then look around, like… “I’m going to go over here.” Why?! Please tell me why!\\r\\n I think my dog thinks I’m insane because I look at my life through her… through her eyes, like, I’ll watch TV for four hours, and from my dog’s point of view, I’m just sitting there.\\r\\n [Sustained laughter, scattered applause]\\r\\n [Exaggerated laughing]\\r\\n “What… the fuck is he laughing, what happened?”\\r\\n My dog is my life now because my kids are grown up, my kids are in college and they’re all, you know… I’m an empty nester. That’s what you call it when your kids are gone… ’cause they grow up, not if they’re dead. It’s not used that way. “My daughter died of leukemia.” “Hey, you’re an empty nester!”\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n I miss it, I miss having little kids. I think about it all the time, I think about it… Maybe adopting, you know, I could adopt a baby from a Third World country. That’s a good thing to do because you can just leave ’em outside, you don’t have to…\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n You know, it’s interesting… We’ve been adopting babies from other countries in America for a long time. You know, other countries do it too, but I live here, so I’ll talk about that, but… It’s an interesting thing. It’s not a biological imperative to go get a baby from thousands of miles away, but we’ve been doing that in large numbers here for a long time, and not always for the same reasons. There’s been different reasons why we’ve done it. In the early, like, in the ’70s, when I grew up, sometimes you’d meet a couple who had an African baby that they brought because there are those kind of, you know, these kinds of people, you know, the kind of couples that hold hands when they announce things. You know those kind of people? They gather their friends and they’re like, “We’ve decided”… You know those…? They have a farm table with a clay pot of honey on it. And their apple juice is cloudy. You know what I’m talking about? Those are the kind of people that make a trip to Zimbabwe and get a baby and name him Kevin and send him to Boston College, whatever.\\r\\n That was like the ’70s and ’80s; then in the ’90s, it became very popular with gay couples, started to adopt babies from China because they want to have a baby, but they can’t… T',\n","  'hey both have dicks. I don’t know if you know that. Did you know that? Gay couples have two dicks, so they can’t make a baby. You can try. You can… This is really fuckin’… You could… [Laughs] You could try to cum into one dick with the other, like, if you line up to dick holes and you could cum, and the sperm goes up this dick and down that one. And then this sperm gets to the balls and he… and they’re like, “What the fuck? Where…?” “Did we turn around? ‘Cause we’re in the balls again.” Whose balls are these?! These aren’t even his balls! Oh, he’s gay. Fuck. All right. Okay, all right. “Well, just swim around until we’re dead.” It’s just the way it is, you’re not going to… A baby will never come out of a penis. Which is good. It’s a good thing. Because it’s hard for women. Imagine pushing a whole baby out of your penis, dickhole. Even just the hand. Yeah. Anyway, so that’s why gay couples adopt. That’s why.\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n And often from China, because they make a lot of stuff there. Uh…\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n So that was that, that was… The gay couples were adopting Chinese babies because they couldn’t have babies, and then… and then a lot of other couples started doing it more around the turn of the century. I used to live in Hollywood, which is a pretty awful place, and everybody there gets Chinese babies. It’s very popular. They go… because… And it’s not because they can’t have babies, and it’s not because they’re trying to help somebody from far away; it’s because they’re just busy; they’re busy… They want to have a baby, but they don’t want to have a baby. You know what I mean? That thing where you can’t have your baby and eat it too, or what… I don’t know how… They want to get pregnant is the point, so they go to China… They don’t even go to China, they go to the airport and somebody from China meets them, gives them a baby… it’s true. They just take it home and then they get a Jamaican nanny to watch their Chinese baby, and they go to cocktail parties. “We have this Chinese baby, it’s amazing.” And meanwhile, the Chinese baby and the Jamaican nanny are just alone, looking at each other like, “What are we doing? What is…? What is this?” Why can’t either of us see our families? Why…? “What the fuck is the point of this?”\\r\\n So, yeah, my dog, I got a dog, my kids are, eh, and I just sit around and watch, uh, watch YouTube a lot… That’s my favorite… pastime. Um… I was watching YouTube today; I was watching one of the ads that comes on before the video I wa… I don’t skip those. I think that’s rude. It is. It’s mean. Somebody worked hard on that ad. They trained a cheetah to run alongside a Jeep Cherokee. And you’re at home like, “Three, two, one… fuck off.” [Laughter] Fucking mean… what if you made something, dick?\\r\\n Anyway, the ad was a PSA. It was a, uh, anti-smoking message. It was a Puerto Rican man with a hole in his throat, he was like… [Imitating electrolarynx]\\r\\n “My father smoked. And my mother smoked. I wish I never smoked in my life. Please don’t smoke cigarettes. Cigarettes are ve',\n","  'ry, very bad for you.”\\r\\n First thought I had was, why does he still have an accent?\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n It’s coming out… Feels like if you bypass the mouth… You shouldn’t have an accident anymore. Does the machine have a setting for “Puerto Rican”? Is that just how air sounds coming out of this guy? Does he fart with an accent? [Imitates flatulence] “Senor, I’m farting!”\\r\\n Anyway, after the ad, I watched the video that I was looking for, which was a scene from a movie, and it’s a scene that I really hate… Every time I see it, it makes me angry, which is why I was looking for it on YouTube. And it’s a movie I like… I actually like the movie. It’s called Good Will Hunting, remember Good Will Hunting?\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n Of course, right? Matt Damon played… A great performance. He plays a very complicated young man w-wearing a tight T-shirt for a whole movie. And here’s the thing… Here’s my issue with Good Will Hunting… Matt Damon also wrote the movie. Okay? So he basically sat down, he’s like, “First of all, I am amazing.” [Laughter] “I’m a construction worker, I’m, like, working-class, and I drink beer and I get in fights, I get into so many fights. My friends are like, ‘You’re out of control, man, ‘ and I’m like, ‘Shut up this is the way I am.’ But then also, I’m a genius. Ooh! I’m not… I didn’t even go to school, I just know things, I don’t know why… I just know them. And all the nerdy geniuses that studied for years are like, “‘He’s so much smarter than us, it’s making it upset’.”\\r\\n It’s insane! It’s fucking insane. It only makes sense if he wrote it for himself to be the guy. So the scene I was looking for, it’s the worst example of that in the movie. Here’s what happens. He goes to a bar and he meets a woman and he likes her. And another guy likes her too. But she picks Matt Damon… because he wrote the fucking movie! Because he decided, you understand?! “She doesn’t like him, she likes me, you better believe it!” [Laughter] So he gets her phone number and then he goes outside and he sees the other guy in the window of a restaurant, and he decides to taunt him, so he goes over… He tells his friends, “Hey, come here, watch this.” And he says to the guy, “Hey, do you like apples?” [Laughter] And the guy says, “Yes.” And Matt Damon goes, “Well, I got her number. How do you like them apples?” And all Matt Damon’s friends go, “Oh-ho!” Ho-ho! This was amazing! Oh! Oh-ho, my God! Oh, my God! You were ready with that! “How?!” You know how he did it? He wrote the whole fucking movie, okay?! He made everybody say all the things. Otherwise, this doesn’t happen. I mean, he hinges the whole fucking prank on the guy likin’ apples; the guy must like apples. Who the fuck… Who would say “yes”… to, “Do you like apples?”… Coming from a clear antagonist… who’s setting him up… Gathered his friends. “Do you… Ha, wait, guys watch this… Do you like apples?” [Sighs] God damn it, I do. I wish I didn’t. ‘Cause I can tell this is not going to go my way. But I just… I can’t lie. They’ll know it. They’ll know it’s becaus',\n","  'e, boy, do I like apples.\\r\\n Do you understand if he says “no,” Matt Damon is fucked. He’s fucked in the face for life. He’s got nothin’! “Do you like apples?” “No.” “D…” [Stammers] [Laughter] “What…” Dude. Fuckin’ guy. No, come on, seriously. Seriously, you fuckin’… Don’t fuckin’… Don’t fuckin’… [Labored breathing] Do… do… do… Do you like bananas? Do… ’cause I thought… ’cause the woman gave me her telephone number, and isn’t that bananas? [Laughter]\\r\\n I saw a guy… I saw a guy peeling a banana the other day. It’s another banana joked, because… Did you hear the other one ended with “banana”? Banana… I got three banana jokes, by the way. This is number two. Okay. I saw a guy peeling a banana on Sixth Avenue, and it bothered me. I’ll tell you why, because it’s the way he… When I peel a banana, I hold around here, I peel down to my hand, right? This guy holds the banana at the bottom. And he just peels the whole thing all the way down. It felt like a guy at a urinal pulling his pants all the way to his ankles. I was like, “Dude, TMI with that banana right now. What are you making a smoothie on Sixth Avenue? What are you doing?” The banana was like, “Hey!” You don’t even know how much you’re going to eat. “I have a bruise right here.”\\r\\n Kind of got lost in the banana shame there. You wanna hear the other banana one now?\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n All right. Okay, so… I was at the grocery store… and I needed bananas. So I go over to where the bananas are, and there’s a Black woman at the bananas. It’s going to be okay. It’s going to be okay, I swear.\\r\\n [Applause]\\r\\n I understand. White people are very scared of discussing bananas and Black people in the same conversation. I understand… if I have a Black friend over, I would never offer him a banana. I just, I don’t know why, I just wouldn’t do it. “Hey, you want a banana?” “Why the fuck you asking me?” “Hey, man, sorry, you have an apple? I’m really sorry.”\\r\\n These are just the facts of the case. All right? I was in a store, looking for bananas and there’s a Black woman in the bananas, and I wanted to… I didn’t want to go there while she’s there because of COVID. We’re all giving each other space. So I… I… But I do want to be next. So I’m waiting. And she’s kind of takin’ a long time. And the longer she takes, the longer I’m a white man watching a Black woman choose bananas. And this is an awful thing about the world today, because I know I’m not doing anything wrong, but I feel fucking bad. I feel fucking bad. So I went to the strawberries. [Chuckles] And there’s a f*ckin’ Jew at the strawberries.\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n “Here’s a nice one!” [Laughs, clears throat] That’s the Jew. I’m not going to do the Black woman. No, not… you know why? Because I’m not afraid of Jews. That’s really… That’s the bottom line. I’m not scared of Jews. I don’t find Jews to be frightening… unless you’re in Palestine, then they’re terrifying. It’s very different. Over there, they’re like, “The Jews are killing us!” And here, we’re like, “Really? The Jews?”\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n',\n","  ' “We’ve been slapping them around for years.” Anyway.\\r\\n “This banana’s too hard!”\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n “Well, this banana’s soft, but I’m not gon’ have it till Tuesday, so… I’m gonna buy the hard one and wait.”\\r\\n Just trying to be fair. Just trying to be fair to the Jews.\\r\\n “Lawd, have mercy.” Anyway…\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n Don’t worry, I’m an old man, I’ll be gone very soon. I worry about getting old only ’cause I don’t want to lose my memory, you know? I mean, some of it I would love to lose. [Laughter] But it doesn’t work that way. You got to take it all or none, I guess. But I lose… I forget things, you know, like, remember Fonzie from Happy Days? I don’t remember him. I don’t even know what you’re talking about.\\r\\n I forget weird things, you know? Like I was walking down the street once in New York and there was a guy in a van and he roll down the window and he said, “Hey, get in the van and suck my d*ck.” And I said, “All right,” you know, so… I got in the van and, you know, I was trying to pull the door, the sliding door, but it kept… and he’s like, “It just shuts, don’t… You don’t have to… I was like, “Sorry.” He’s like, “Everybody does that, it’s okay.” So I’m kneeling on the floor of the van on like a purse, and there’s no lady in there, but I’m like, “I came here to suck this guy’s d*ck, not, like, take inventory. I should just get to work,” so I started suckin’ his d*ck, and about halfway through… I’m guessing… I remembered… that, I don’t really like doing that.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n So, senior moment.\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Some people worry about getting old because they think it means that they’re dying, which it does. But this doesn’t worry me… I don’t worry about dying because I think it’s necessary. I think it’s something that you just have to do. You should do it. It’s… when it’s your turn, you should do it. If somebody you know, your doctor says you’re dying, just say, “Okay,” and die… Don’t, you know, “May be a miracle?” Fuck you, get in the ground, just take your turn. I really think that way now… I didn’t used to, but I do, because I…\\r\\n You know when I started thinking that way was when my mom died. My mom died a couple of years ago of anorexia. She was 300 pounds. She was bad at it. [Laughter] I know it’s fucked up, right? [Laughter] Hmm. What a piece of shit. Anyway… She would have liked that joke. She would have! My mom, fuckin’, she was gross. And I remember when she was dying, I was… I was alone with her, and the nurse said, “This is… this is imminent.” I was like, “What does that mean?” She goes, “It’s… she’s going to die in a minute.” I’m like, “Just say, ‘in a minute’. It’s so close.” Anyway, I was alone with her and she died, and I was like, “Fuck, they’re going to think I did it, obviously.”\\r\\n I didn’t want to lose my mom, I really didn’t, but I… but we had this one conversation, like, two weeks before she died, when we were… We were talking about it and I said, “Mom, I don’t want you to die.” And she said, “You’ll get over it.” That’s what she said! And I did. But in ',\n","  'the moment, I wasn’t willing to accept it, I was like, “I don’t want you to go,” she said, “But we’re going in order.” Do you understand? This makes sense. I’m your mother,” I’m like, “Mom, stop talking like that. This is sad,” she goes, “No, it’s not. Look at it this way, would… Do you want me to never die?” I was like, “No, I don’t want that at all.”\\r\\n And it helped me get in touch with an important idea, which is that dying is important, it’s every generation’s greatest contribution to history is that they die. It’s the only thing that keeps things moving; it’s the only reason there’s any progress in the human race is that folks keep fucking dying. Every generation has had a mix of douche bags and amazing people and boring, great, good, whatever, but they’re all fucking dead. Every fuckin’ one. Thank God, they’re all fucking dead. There’s a limit to how much any of the good ones did, and the shitty ones got to stop being shitty. It’s a great system. Now, when you look at the Internet and all these people, you’re like, “What the fuck is happening?” They’… it’s okay. They’re all going! Every th… All of them are going to die. I mean, you don’t want to die.\\r\\n [Cheers and applause]\\r\\n You don’t want to die, you don’t want your loved ones to die, but that’s a selfish wish when you think about what would happen if nobody died… What kind of world would this be if there was no… Nobody d… If we still had people here from the 1100s? It’s hard enough having people here from the ’50s! “Sir, just scan the code on the table, there’s no menu.” “What?! I don’t understand!” Jesus Christ! You want to go through that with Pontius Pilate and Charlemagne?\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n Fucking pain in the ass. Fucking old people that don’t want to fucking, just, when you get older and you start going, “Everything’s so crazy now”… No, it’s fine, just get the fuck out. It’s great. They’re not going to make it work for you, you’re here for 10 more minutes, just get the fuck out.\\r\\n If you’re in an airport and you’re looking at the toilet and you’re like, “I don’t understand how this works,” it’s time for you to die, that’s what that means. These toilets are for the next people, get the fuck out.\\r\\n That’s the way I look at my life now. I had some good, I had some bad, but I’m done. I mean, I’m… I’ll hang around ’cause I’m curious. But I’m so interested in the way things are going, I really am, it’s such an interesting time, such a… we’re on a hinge, it’s such a cool thing to experience that. I’m excited about a lot of what’s coming, there’s things that are hard now, but that’s the way it is. Things are going to get…\\r\\n I think it’s exciting what’s happening; I think young people today have some great ideas. They’re being a little cunty about some of them, but the ideas are good. The ideas are good. Like, when I was growing up, we had two genders… Male and female. Now you have all these expansion teams. I think it’s very exciting. It is! And the best idea is this gender fluid thing. This is a great fucking idea. Gender fluid, the idea, the',\n","  ' way I barely understand it, is that you… you just… Something in the middle. It’s like a fretless bass. You don’t have to be… The specific pictures… What a dumb way to do it. “These are the kinds of people you can be, which one are you?” “I don’t feel like any of those people.” “Then you’re a failure. You have to fi… Start acting like these people so we know what to call you.” Why?! Just make it a… It’s just a… pbbt, What, just… A la carte, “I like d*cks, I don’t like balls, I’m a… this and… moving through it, changing when it feels like it.”\\r\\n I wish… what I’m saying is I wish we had that when I was a kid, because I think our generation got hurt by the rigidity of identities and how you had to just stick to them. You didn’t pick one right away. You’re eight years old, “What are you?” “I’m a… I’m a boy.” “What do you like?” “Uh, girls… Vaginas! Love vaginas!” I’m eight years old, I never saw one, but I’m committing my life to them right now. I don’t even get to smell one for a second! Just a sniff! [Sniffs] “All right, what else you got?”\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Ten years old, “Are you gay?” “No, no, no, I hate d*cks, hate ’em.” What do I know? I didn’t even get to fidget with one for a minute!\\r\\n [Laughter]\\r\\n “This banana’s too hard!”\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n I’m not saying I wish I could have blown all my friends to see what it’s like. But on 4th of July, there were fireworks, I was with Matt, there was a feeling… I don’t know what could have happened. I have no idea… Because we were so scared. We were so… We were afraid to seem gay when I was a kid, ’cause in the ’70s, the stereotypes showed you what everybody is like. [Deep voice] Men are like this. [Falsetto] And then the women have to act like this, and then gay people are like… they’re just tired. That was gay people in the ’70s. “I’m gay. Help, I’m gay, I can’t even do anything.” That’s what gay men were in the ’70s.\\r\\n You ever meet a gay person? You don’t fuck with gay people, not today. They’re all athletes, first of all. And they… they got their shit together. They’re fucking… their motherfuckers, gay people. Your landlord’s gay. They’re billionaires! They own Apple. They’re in the cabinet, they’re in the Navy. They’re… they’re… they’re cowboys and Indians and construction workers. Gay men are men. You ever go in a gay-owned business? He’s like, “Can I help you?” Like, the gay’s in there, but he’s fucking tough now. “This is my store, motherfucker, what do you want?” Gay men are men now. They’re… they’re fathers, they’re husbands, they’re men. Today’s heterosexual men are f*ggots. I don’t know how that happened!\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n And I… but they’re f*gs!\\r\\n [Cheering and applause]\\r\\n I’m saying that with love and as an old man on his way out the door, but they’re fucking f*gs! They’re intelligent and they’re evolved, but they’re f*gs, with the pajama shorts?! And the… just pale, almost blue. “Mm, my wife got a promotion today.” Oh, good for you, f*ggot. I’m so happy. I am! I’m happy for him! Sounds like a good… They have a',\n","  ' good life together. But it takes some getting used to for me… When I see a progressive young couple, I always want to stop them and ask her, “Is that turning you on? Please tell me, is that sexy?” He… with the Tin Man’s hand pipe, just… Strawberry smoke. “Pbbt!” She’s like, Well, he’s very intelligent “and he’s conscientious”… But does he make your p*ssy wet? “Fuck, no, he’s a f*g. But I love him.”\\r\\n And again, great, it’s another kind of dude, “f*ggy straight dude,” it’s another kind of guy. Welcome! We should have all of it, the whole spectrum, the whole alphabet, all of it. But somebody does have to be just a straight fucking. You have to have that. It doesn’t have to be the most important, but you do need it because it’s where it all fuckin’ comes from. Until they figure out some other shit, this is where life still starts. If… if you want to eat local and organic, you got to respect that someone’s got to have a hard d*ck f*cking a p*ssy. That’s… that’s where every trans, every gay person, came from… two boring straight people f*cking. I mean, that’s just… for now, it’s… someone needs… You could… With an original d*ck, not a turned-inside-out p*ssy wrapped in thigh flesh… Which is wonderful! Wonderful! You got to respect that! You do! Somebody who wants to be themselves so bad they rip their balls off… That takes balls to do that. It does! Fuckin’ respect! But someone’s got to have a factory d*ck with matching numbers, fucking a wet, farm-raised p*ssy.\\r\\n [Laughter and applause]\\r\\n Thank you very much. Good night, everybody.

Gosh, that’s way… Come on, now. Please. That is… That is so nice. Keep going forever.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Look at this. Here we are. London Palladium. My gosh.\\r\\n [cheering]\\r\\n Thank you so much for coming out. Oh, my days. Oh. Let me put this away. The biggest stage in the world so I’ll be back in about half an hour.\\r\\n Guys, thank you so much for coming out tonight. I really appreciate it. Here we are. It’s taken a few more months longer than expected, but here we are. Look at this, a sold-out, reduced capacity, London Palladium!\\r\\n [laughing and cheering]\\r\\n Oh, my gosh. Oh, man. Thank you so much for coming.\\r\\n So we were meant to film this last year. We were meant to film this in May of 2020. But something came up. We had to push it back. But we made it. Here we are. We’re finally doing it. I can’t wait to do the show. I hope it is all still relevant.\\r\\n This show is about Brexit and how much I want to meet Prince Philip. Let’s go! Let’s do it! Should be good, should be fun.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I’m Phil Wang, in case you didn’t know. Here I am. Old Philly Philly Wang Wang. Here at last. Old Philly Philly Wang Wang at the London Phalladium.\\r\\n So good to be here. Phil Wang. Uh, I’m a mixed race fella. As the name “Phil Wang” might suggest. At some point here, a cultural compromise was made. Yes, well, my father is a Chinese Malaysian, hence the “Wang.” And the rest of my body. My father is Chinese Malaysian, uh, but my mother is, uh, normal. So, yeah, got some sour cream in that chili.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Didn’t want you to burn your tongue on that hot Wang, so Mama brought the milk.\\r\\n White and Chinese, those are my races. White and Chinese. Phil and Wang. White and Chinese. I’m the most powerful race on Earth! I got the big ones, baby! Smoosh them together. I’m white and Chinese. People have tried to tell me that I’m a minority.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’m like, “I’m both majorities, bitch. I’m white and Chinese.”\\r\\n [laughing and applauding]\\r\\n You can’t touch me. I’m Pepsi and Coke. I’m like a full market share. They sell Wang everywhere. I’m white and Chinese. I’m everywhere. You can’t run from me. I’m around every corner. Hello. Ni hao. I’m Alien and Predator. I’m white and Chinese. I’m future-proof, baby. Completely future-proof. No matter what happens over the next 50 years, Wang, or Phil, is fine.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Probably Wang, though.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n The way things are going.\\r\\n It’s weird looking like me at the moment. In the wake of the COVID pandemic, it’s weird looking like me. Uh, Chinese, not muscular. It’s weird looking Chinese at the moment. This whole pandemic, it’s been bad for the brand, to say the least. Honestly, the last thing we needed, especially in the UK. The last thing East Asian Chinese Brits needed. East Asian Brits, East Asians in Britain, very low profile in the UK. So low, in fact, that we don’t even have the word “Asian” here. Most places in the world, we at least have the word “Asian.” Not in the UK. In the UK,',\n","  ' the word “Asian,” usually refers to South Asian, right? Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi. Which is fine. But there’s this whole other half of Asia they’re missing out on. A whole other, I would say, bigger half.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n There’s a whole other half of Asia missing out there. There’s two types of Asian in the world. There’s more, but I don’t have that much time. Fundamentally, there are two main categories of Asian in the world. There’s Cricket Asian.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n By the sounds of it, you already know who those guys are. You’ve never heard “Cricket Asian” in your life and instantly you knew who I was talking about. So there’s Cricket Asian, and then there’s Eats-Weird-Shit Asian.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now, I am a member of Eats-Weird-Shit Asian. I’m a proud Eats-Weird-Shit Asian. I eats that weird shit. But it’s kind of awkward being an Eats-Weird-Shit Asian at the moment ’cause that’s how this whole catastrophe started in the first place.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n One of us ate one piece of weird shit too far. After centuries of living on the wild side, we pushed our luck and it finally snapped on the wings of a bat. It’s awful. Why now? It’s always been fine up till now. I ate weird shit as a kid. Nothing like this ever happened. Growing up in Malaysia, I was eating weird shit. Loved it. Loved eating weird shit. I would eat, like, uh, squid jerky. [growls] I was eating little wriggly sea snails, straight out of the shell. Mmm. I was eating jellyfish. I was eating pig intestine soup. Uh, we’d eat the whole fish for dinner. Whole fish. My little sister would go, “Shotgun, the eyes!” Me and my other sister would be like, “Naw!”\\r\\n It’s just a different culture out there. In the West, people are a little squeamish about the more extreme ends of the culinary spectrum. Out in the East, there’s a sense of delicacy to the strange. Nowhere more so than China. China itself. I got to see this firsthand in China recently. Went there for the first time. China. The big C. Asia Classic.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Chinatown Plus. China. At the start of 2020, I got to go to China. Unrelated, it wasn’t me.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n Awkward timing, in retrospect, but it wasn’t me. I got to go to China for a job, and while I was out there, I got to go to a food market. Not sounding good, I’ll give you that. I got to go to a food market out there in China. And they were selling all sorts of Chinese snacks. There’s stalls selling noodles, some selling buns, blah, blah, blah. But there was one stall that was dedicated to weird pieces of shit. Critters, essentially. Deep-fried, roasted critters. Bugs. Locusts. There was a lizard, on a stick, just dried like: Crucified lizard, like this. People would walk past and go, “Oh, I’ll have the Jesus lizard, please.” Uh, “One Passion of the Lizard, thank you.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n There were snakes curled up like sausages with a spike through them. I partook, sure! I ate a full tarantula on a stick. Like that. Tried to do it in two halves, surprisingly tough, tarantula. So I had to just down it in one. Like a legend.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I ate a centipede. Good thing about a c',\n","  'entipede, plenty of drumsticks for everyone.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I ate a couple of roasted cockroaches. But they’re resilient, cockroaches. Crawled out of my butt. They’re gonna inherit the world.\\r\\n It’s just a cultural thing. A cultural difference. Like, in the West, you know that nursery rhyme, I know an old lady who swallowed a fly I don’t know why she swallowed a fly Perhaps she’ll die It’s a banger.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n And in this nursery rhyme, this old lady goes on to eat increasingly large animals to catch the previous animal she ingested, which she now regrets having inside her. First she swallows a fly, by accident. Then she swallows a spider… I know what that’s like.\\r\\n …to catch the fly. Then she swallows a bird to catch the spider, then a cat to catch the bird, then a dog to catch the cat, then a horse to catch the dog.\\r\\n Now, in the West, this nursery rhyme is a cautionary tale…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …about how sometimes the solution can be worse than the problem. In China, this is a Michelin star tasting menu…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …with an admittedly heavy dessert, horse!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Oof. “We’ll just have the one. Two spoons, thank you.”\\r\\n It’s just a cultural difference. But no reason we should get that there racism because of it. That there COVID racism? I don’t want that there COVID racism, no thank you. I’m terrified of that there COVID racism. I don’t want to get that on me. Terrified. Even at home alone, “Oh!” I hear a noise, I’m like, “Racism?” “Did I leave a window open? Did racism get in?”\\r\\n Just me and my devices at home, alone… Even my devices I don’t trust. My devices are racist now. My phone especially. I think my phone is definitely racist. I was on my phone the other day, and I typed the word, uh, “Nazis” into my phone, right? You don’t need to know why.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I typed the word “Nazis” into my phone. All lowercase, right, n-a-z-i-s, all lowercase. I was in a hurry. You know what sexting’s like.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You gotta be quick. The vibe’s not gonna last forever. So I typed into my phone, n-a-z-i-s, all lowercase. And then instantly, my phone autocorrected it to replace the “n” at the beginning with a capital “N” as if to say, “Oi! Show some goddamn respect.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Those are Nazis you’re talking about… Phil Wand.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I got a far-right phone that thinks I’m a creepy magician. Terrible.\\r\\n Scary times. Not the scariest times we’ve lived through. Not really the most dangerous times we’ve lived through. But it’s the abstract nature of this new danger that has driven us insane. It’s so abstract. It’s an invisible virus. So abstract, some of us don’t even believe it’s real. Threat and danger have become more abstract as the 21st century’s progressed. With it, we’ve been becoming more insane. At the start of this century, threat and danger were very real, physical, tangible things, you know? After 9/11, War on Terror, back then, the threat, the thing that we were all told to look out for was just a guy, covered in bombs… who would come in and go: [yells] “I’m covered in bombs, everyone! I’m covered in bombs and I love it, to be frank!”\\r\\n [lau',\n","  'ghs]\\r\\n We’d see him and go, “Okay, I’ll stay away from that guy.” Problem solved. Clear, tangible threat.\\r\\n Then threats started getting abstract. The next thing we were all told to look for was unattended packages. Remember unattended packages? I long for the day of the unattended package. We were obsessed with unattended packages for a while. Mid-noughties, golden age of the unattended package. All we cared about back then, unattended packages and Malcolm in the Middle. Now there were just packages out there. There wasn’t even a guy involved. Now there were just packages out there, and it was down to us to assess each one’s level of attendance.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Responsibility had shifted onto the public. We all still had our lives to live, but now we’d been burdened with a new unpaid second job of being bag spotters! We’d try our best, but it was terrifying. We’d go out, living our mid-noughties lives, down the library or the cyber cafe…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …and from time to time, we’d see a backpack just lying on the ground. And we’d freak out! We’d go, [yells] “It’s a package!” “And it’s unattended!” “Quick! Someone attend it!” Then someone would run over, [panting] we’d be like, “Phew. That was close.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But then threat got more abstract still. Then with the Internet, as life moved online, the thing we were told to look out for were bots and hackers and Russians. Then we found out none of them could tick a box that says “I’m not a robot.” That seemed to solve the problem.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now with the coronavirus, threat is the most abstract it’s ever been. Now threat is like a surface.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n “Be careful of a surface, everyone.” “No, you should be fine, as long as you steer clear of them surfaces. They’ll get you.” Awful to find out, home alone, watching the news. “Oh, shit, surfaces!” I did a quick scan of my flat. Fucking surfaces everywhere! Death trap, that place! Didn’t realize I was living in Saw III.\\r\\n Even now I’m terrified. My friends are like, “Wanna come over, have dinner in the garden?” I’m like, “Uh, maybe. Could you check quickly… Do you have any surfaces over there?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n What are we having dinner on? A table? Are you trying to kill me? You’re out of the bubble, buddy.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Scary times, man. I’m getting more scared. Getting older. Maybe you get more fearful as you age. Getting older. That’s scary itself, getting older. Holy shit, I thought I’d at least have this year off. No. Older again. So fucking old now, man. I became so old this year. Don’t know about you guys, but I became older recently. Became so old this year. Broke my personal record, actually. Became so old. I turned 31 this year. Bleh!\\r\\n [jeers]\\r\\n I know. Disgusting. Yes, you’re right. I’m gonna be sick. Bleh! So old. Thirty-freaking-one. I went into lockdown 19 years old. Now I’m 31. Terrible.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Awful. So fucking old. Thirty-one. This shit’s nearly over, folks. This is my farewell special, by the way. Oh, my God. Knockin’ on hell’s door over here. I’m 31. I’m so old. Uh, this may annoy some people.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I come onstage and I say, “I’m',\n","  ' 31, I’m so old.” There’s always a couple of people in the crowd, like, “Oh, 31’s not old. Oh, shut up, 31’s nothing. You’re a baby. Turning 31. Pfft. Give me a break!” But they’re always really fucking old, so…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Doesn’t make me feel better.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n They’re like 43 and shit. I don’t care.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Forgive me if I take no comfort from the jealous face of death itself. Mr. Magoo and Maggie Smith think I’m a spring chicken. Oh, great.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I know 31’s not, like, “old” old. But it’s not “young” young anymore either. It doesn’t fizz with the excitement of the twenties. Thirty-one’s a pretty serious age. One of the first serious ages. Life starts to ossify at 31. Shit starts to get serious. People start committing to things long-term. I’ve got to that age now where all my friends have started having, uh, podcasts.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n So I had to have one too, to keep up with the crowd. But I wasn’t ready.\\r\\n My body’s falling apart. Body’s giving up the fucking ghost, man. Crumbling into a disgusting paste, this body. Awful. Gets worse and worse every day. Every morning I wake up to a new leak on this ship.\\r\\n It doesn’t even make sense anymore, the shit that goes wrong with my body. It used to make sense. Back in the day, I’d stub my toe, then my toe would hurt. It was a clear line of cause and effect.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now, my body skips the first step. Just straight to pain, unexplained. I just go, “Oh, why?” And my body’s like, “Fuck you, that’s why.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n It’s improvising now, my body. It’s gone full jazz. Doesn’t have to make sense at all. Like, the other day I woke up, and one of my balls hurt. It just hurt. I didn’t do anything to it. I didn’t deserve that. I didn’t go to bed the night before like: [sighs, then grunts] Now I’m relaxed. I didn’t do that. But still, just one painful ball in the morning. Just exhausted by a long night’s sleep, I guess.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’s where I’m at now. Tired by rest.\\r\\n I’ve got a bad back. Thirty-one, back’s a-crackin’. My memory’s not what it used to be. Or maybe it is. I have no way of knowing.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Maybe it’s the same and I forgot.\\r\\n My farts are disgusting now. My farts are so bad. I thought my farts were bad before. Pfft. Ha! If only young Wang knew…\\r\\n ♪ What fragrant days he lived in ♪\\r\\n ♪ I should have savored them While I had the chance ♪\\r\\n Ah!\\r\\n Now my farts are revolting.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Absolutely disgusting, my farts now. They’re quieter now, I’ll give them that. My farts are quieter now. But they’re worse. For you.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n My young farts were loud and ostentatious. But, ultimately, kind on the nose. They weren’t interested in hurting anyone, my young farts. They were in it for the show, really, my young farts. They were like fireworks, my young farts.\\r\\n [mimics fireworks]\\r\\n Then Chinese people would come. “Yeah.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Good luck. Good luck for the coming year.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now my farts are like the silent leaking of an abandoned chemical factory. Just slowly poisoning the groundwater.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Killing the local dogs. It’s terrible. Terrible, my farts are. The',\n","  'y’re absolutely disgusting, so bad.\\r\\n Have you ever done a fart so bad that you, uh, lost a bar of Wi-Fi?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I swear the other day… Swear to God, I was at home and I let one rip and [blows raspberry] Netflix got blurry for a bit. You know when it’s like, it gets the squares. “Come on!”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Body’s changing, I guess. Body’s changing. Thirty-one, my body’s changing. My mind’s changing. My soul’s changing. My personality’s changed a lot. My opinions. My political persuasion’s changed. So much from a couple years ago. I used to think I was a Socialist. That was me. Just a couple of years ago. Little Philly Philly Wang Wang with his red cap on.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n “Mm! I’m a Socialist. Boo-boo-boo. A little bit for everyone. It only seems fair.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Boo-boo-boo. Nationalize the sea. Oh, I’m a Socialist.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But looking back now, I realize I just didn’t have money.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I have money now. I’m not sharing that shit! That’s mine! Back off, you dirty Commies!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Wang made that pound.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Turns out capitalism’s okay when you got, uh, capital.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n The clue was in the name the whole time.\\r\\n I just want to be rich now. I used to want world peace and now I just want to be fucking minted.\\r\\n And I know that’s not a very meaningful pursuit, money for its own sake. But honesty is a meaningful pursuit. And if I’m being honest, I just want to be loaded. I just wanna be rich. I mean, I’m already rich. We’re all rich, technically speaking. By global standards, everyone in this room is fucking Bezos. Everyone in this room is Nebuchadnezzar by global standards. I don’t give a shit about global standards. Have you been to the globe?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n The globe is filthy. We don’t live in the globe. We live in the UK. On the edge of the world, looking in, tutting. I don’t wanna be globe-rich. That’s like 10 pounds. I don’t wanna be globe-rich. I wanna be proper rich. I want to be UK rich. And not just for the big, obvious things. Not the cars, houses, killing people and getting away with it.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’s all lovely, sure. But it’s the little things that I want to be rich for. The little touches that make being rich wonderful. Like, I wanna send a bottle of champagne across a restaurant to an acquaintance who hasn’t noticed I’m there yet.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Mwah!\\r\\n That’s some sweet rich-person-only shit. I’ve seen that in the films and Wang wants in. They’re over there, all sad on their own, eating their fish, and they ain’t got no champagne. Out of nowhere, the waiter pops up. “Oh, this is from the gentleman over there in the rabbit onesie.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’m rich! I can wear what I like! You’ve not seen opulence till you’ve seen a full-grown man doff an ear…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …across a crowded Bella Italia.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Mm. Mwah! Ooh, la, la. It’d certainly impress my date.\\r\\n I’m back on the dating scene now.\\r\\n [whooping]\\r\\n Single once more. Ah, yes.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Single fella, single now. Broke up with my girlfriend. Great way to become single. Highly effective, it turns out. So once more, dating. Dating too much, man. Dati',\n","  'ng way too much. Dating too much. Dating far too much. Chasing my tail with all the dating. Running in this mirage of happiness that keeps receding further into the horizon. I’m trying to make up for something with all this dating. I’m trying to make up for what I perceive to have been a rather, uh, sexless youth. You know? I mean, not childhood. Probably for the best, whatever.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But later. Like late teens, early twenties. That time in your life when you’re supposed to get it out of your system. Just get on your knees, batten down the hatches and just fuckin’…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Just experiment! Fucking yeah! Just fuck your way to clarity.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Move on, get a job, buy a sensible hatchback.\\r\\n I never did that. I never made the most of those opportunities. University, the big one. I didn’t really have sex at university. Uh, for religious reasons. Uh, God hates me.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’ve been trying to make up for it. I’ve been trying to pay back this sexual deficit I feel I incurred. This sexual debt upon which I have imposed my own rate of interest that I cannot keep up with. Deep in with the Wang Bank over here.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Sure, the occasional repayment is fun enough, but it’s not a tenable way to live.\\r\\n I’m on the old dating apps too. On the old apps. Gotta get on the apps. That can be a depressing venture. I discovered pits of desperation I did not know I was low enough to crawl into, on the dating apps.\\r\\n Like, have you ever swiped right on a group photo…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …not knowing which one of them it is, just, “Yeah, any of them. Yeah, whatever. I’ll date anyone who can afford that ski trip.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n There’s a Labrador in there. “I’ll take the dog, whatever. He’s got a healthy coat.”\\r\\n Beggars can’t be choosers, I suppose, and East Asian guys, we have a difficult time on the dating apps. This is a documented phenomenon. East Asian men have the hardest time on dating apps of any group. In the West. I think in, like, Korea, they’re fine.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But in the West, East Asian men, Chinese men, we’re rarely considered viable, sexual options. It’s not how we’re portrayed in public culture, in media. We’re never really the sexy guys. Usually we’re portrayed as these sort of gormless, bucktooth fools who are primarily asexual. Like, completely uninterested in sex. Which is mad, considering how many Chinese people there are.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n 1.4 billion people, that’s with the one-child policy. We fuck so good they had to give us a rule.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [applauding and whooping]\\r\\n No one else got a rule.\\r\\n But still, you know, these negative perceptions persist. But I understand. I’m not angry about it. A culture’s aesthetic tastes, its beauty standards, are a difficult thing to shift, informed by many things. What a society finds beautiful is informed by its own cultural makeup, it’s informed by its literature, its language and its poetry. And sometimes I think the English language just isn’t equipped to fully appreciate East Asian male beauty.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n For example, we have very dark eyes, right? East Asian guys have very dark eyes. Some o',\n","  'f us have very dark eyes. Some of us have black eyes. Coal-black eyes of a snake.\\r\\n I don’t know if you’ve tried, but it’s very difficult to be romantic, in English, at least, about black eyes. If you have blue eyes, green eyes, good for you, that shit’s easy.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n “Oh, you have green eyes! Like the purest emerald. Oh! Oh, you have blue eyes. When I look in your eyes, it’s like I’m swimming in the ocean. Oh!” Whatever.\\r\\n Black eyes. What can you say about black eyes? “Oh, you have black eyes. They remind me of death.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n They are like the endless abyss. When I look in your eyes, it’s like I’m closing my eyes.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Still, I guess I do all right. Um… I’ve dated some lovely ladies. Got no kids to show for it, as a bonus. No kids. No-child policy over here.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I don’t have any kids. My ex, she was on the old contraceptives. Yeah, a couple of fans in? Big fan of the contraceptives. Grateful to my ex for being on contraceptives. Grateful to all you ladies, for being on the old contraceptives.\\r\\n [women whooping]\\r\\n Thank you very much, yes. On behalf of the fellas, cheers.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Appreciate it. You’ve been taking one for the team for a while. Not gone unnoticed.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You’re doing great work. Keep it up. And it’s not fair that you ladies have to do most of it still. ‘Cause it’s not like male equivalents haven’t been developed. They have! We just haven’t told ya.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n We’re sneaky like that, us guys. It’s why you love us. They have. They made a male pill a couple years ago. They came up with a contraceptive pill for men. But the test subjects found that it actually sort of altered their body chemistry. Made them feel a bit sad.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n So they all went… “Hm… Must not be ready yet.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Women can keep using their pill, which we presume is perfect by now.”\\r\\n A mechanical solution was developed for the guys. A little cork device that they just… Right there. Right there. The equivalent of the coil. Right there. Cork and the Coil. There’s a kids book. Right there. Just a little cork they put right there. Brute force approach, it worked. Right there. A little cork they put up there in the tube. It’ll just sit up there and stop the swimmers getting through. Just like a hard border. Right there. Just like putting a difficult immigrations officer up inside.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n “These passports are expired!” They’ll have to swim back and: “Aw…”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I do quite a good sperm impression. I don’t know why. I’m half sperm. Yeah.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Uh, dad’s side, if you’re wondering.\\r\\n But again, men found that procedure a little invasive, so… They went, “Uh, women can keep using the implant for now.”\\r\\n It’s not fair. It’s not fair, ladies. I appreciate that, and, men, we should help. We should help carry that burden. Share the load. Pardon the pun.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But there’s an intractable problem with male contraception. Which no one in the industry seems to be talking about. An intractable problem with male contraception, which is that, even if a guy were to get these things done to him, with the best of intenti',\n","  'ons, what woman is going to believe him?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Right? There’s a lot of trust that goes with unseen contraception. A lot of jeopardy. None of the jeopardy falls on the man’s side. You know? A lady gets pregnant, she deals with it. The guy, he can just fuck off. I mean, you shouldn’t.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You shouldn’t, fellas. You shouldn’t. But you totally can. But you shouldn’t!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You mustn’t… Don’t! But it’s very easy. But you shouldn’t! But you must refrain. But flights are so cheap now. But you shouldn’t!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You can get the Belgian passport on the dark web. Know that? Full Belgian passport.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Different name, new address. But you shouldn’t! But the option’s always open to you.\\r\\n If you’re a lady, you gotta deal with that shit. The guy, you don’t really. Which is why we don’t need convincing a lady’s sorted out with contraceptives. You can make shit up, ladies. Have fun with it. Could be like, “Oh, yeah, a magical squirrel put a curse on me once, and, uh, now I cannot bear child.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n And even a smart guy would be like, “Yeah, I think I read that. Yeah, sure. Let’s do it.”\\r\\n It doesn’t work the other way around. Say all these male contraceptives come on the market. I go down to the clinic. Get tooled up. And I go out on the town. Take it for a spin.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Then I go to a bar, chat up a girl. She’s into it for some reason. Maybe she’s sick.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n We go back to my place. We start kissing. Sure, why not? It’s 2021, keep up. We start kissing. We get a little bit less-than-clothed. A little nakey-nu, as they say in France. And… just before we get down and dirty, she goes, “Ooh, you have any protection?” And I just go, “Don’t worry, baby. Wang’s on the pill.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Who, me? I got a cork in my balls! I know you’ve never heard of it, but trust me! The man you met at All Bar One.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I got a cork in my balls! Put ’em in the sink. They’ll float, you’ll see.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’d never work. I need a doctor’s note from the UN for that shit! I’d need Malala to sign it. “He’s got a cork in his balls. I am Malala.”\\r\\n I’d love a cork in my balls. You kiddin’? Oh! I’d love a cork in my balls! London Palladium, if you take nothing else from this show… And you won’t.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …please remember Phil would love a cork in his balls! Can you imagine the peace of mind that must come with having a cork in your balls?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Oh! I’d just swan about town, making love, not a care in the world with a cork in my balls. When I do meet the one and want to settle down, I just pop that shit like champagne.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Across a crowded Bella Italia.\\r\\n [laughing and applauding]\\r\\n Thank you.\\r\\n Love a… I’d love a cork in my balls. I’d love a cork in my balls. I would absolutely love a cork in my balls.\\r\\n I wouldn’t want the pill. I don’t want to be on the male pill.\\r\\n I don’t want another thing to remember to do.\\r\\n I got enough shit in my routine. That’s the most impressive one, the pill.\\r\\n I’m in so much admiration for women on the pill.\\r\\n That’s the most badass one. It requires the most of you.\\r\\n The disciplin',\n","  'e. The determination.\\r\\n The strength of character.\\r\\n The memory, just the memory!\\r\\n You have to remember to do it every day. It’s gotta be hard.\\r\\n No matter what, you gotta remember every day.\\r\\n It’s gotta be difficult. Especially if you’re not getting any at the time.\\r\\n Brief moment of candor, ladies,\\r\\n but that’s gotta be a kick to the old soul there…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n if you’re a sister going through a dry patch…\\r\\n and you still gotta pop the old sex pill every day.\\r\\n That’s a bit of a taunt, isn’t it?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Every day. Think of what that is. If you’re not having sex at the time,\\r\\n being on the contraceptive pill, that is a daily,\\r\\n oral reminder\\r\\n of your own squandered sexual potential.\\r\\n Every day just a gulp of loneliness with breakfast.\\r\\n [groans] Every day.\\r\\n Only women are emotionally strong enough to persist with something like that.\\r\\n Can you imagine if guys had to do anything like that?\\r\\n We wouldn’t last a week!\\r\\n Can you imagine if guys had to get up every morning, just crawl out of bed,\\r\\n and just strap on a condom every morning?\\r\\n Just like… [whimpers]\\r\\n “Maybe today.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Hopefully. [whines]”\\r\\n Just rolls it up his flaccid penis.\\r\\n [whining]\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Pulls up his trousers and goes to work with his condom on.\\r\\n [groaning]\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n It rides down all day like a tube top. He’s gotta keep pulling…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Distracts him at work. [groans]\\r\\n “Andy, are you all right?” “Sorry, it’s just…”\\r\\n “You’re fired.” “Oh, no.”\\r\\n He goes out clubbing that night. “Yeah. Oh, no.”\\r\\n Tries to chat up a girl. “You look nice.”\\r\\n “Ew, gross. Fuck off.”\\r\\n He has to go home alone.\\r\\n Up to his bedroom.\\r\\n “Not today.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n He just peels off this dry condom.\\r\\n Staples it to that day on the calendar.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Just think about the story you applauded.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’d love a cork in my balls.\\r\\n [audience laughs]\\r\\n I’d love a cork in my balls.\\r\\n It doesn’t make sense for ladies to do it still.\\r\\n In the 21st century, it makes no sense. It used to. Back in the day.\\r\\n Back when we were nomads roaming the plains.\\r\\n You remember those times.\\r\\n It made sense. Back then, duties of the sexes were clearly delineated.\\r\\n Back then, the lady, she took on full reproductive responsibility\\r\\n ’cause the guy, he’d taken on full survival responsibility. Right?\\r\\n He goes out there, you know, fighting off rival tribes and gathering meat.\\r\\n But now anyone can buy a fuckin’ Subway, you know. Who cares?\\r\\n Doesn’t matter who does what anymore. But back in the day, it did matter.\\r\\n Back then if a lady got pregnant, that was a full-time job.\\r\\n ‘Cause it takes it out of you, being preggers on the savanna.\\r\\n It’s brutal, the human pregnancy. Uniquely brutal in the animal kingdom.\\r\\n For a species our size, it takes a long time.\\r\\n It leaves a woman physically incapacitated.\\r\\n We’re an upright animal, which is weird already,\\r\\n and now, she can’t bend over to pick up any rocks\\r\\n to throw at a saber-tooth.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n So she has to keep her fella sweet so he’ll hang around and protect her.\\r\\n “Hey, baby, this mammoth giving you trouble?”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Fight ',\n","  'off the triceratops. My history’s not great.\\r\\n She’s walking around, pregnant. For nine months!\\r\\n A sitting duck for nine months! Then she gives birth to that thing.\\r\\n It’s not over yet, lady! Now she’s gotta pick it up and hold it!\\r\\n For, like, two years.\\r\\n That’s her arms gone now.\\r\\n She can’t even uppercut the pterodactyls anymore.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n She’s gotta hold this fuckin’ useless baby all the time!\\r\\n ‘Cause they’re useless, human babies. Fucking useless…\\r\\n Fucking useless, human babies. Sorry.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Absolutely useless, human babies.\\r\\n A moment away from death at all times. Can’t survive on their own at all.\\r\\n The second they’re born, with their big, bowling ball heads\\r\\n balanced precariously on their toothpick necks.\\r\\n Every time you pick one up, they’re like, “Try not to kill me!”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’s why we came up with morality in the first place.\\r\\n You know, humans, we had to invent this thing called kindness\\r\\n so we didn’t boot our babies into the bush and move on!\\r\\n ‘Cause they’re liabilities!\\r\\n Other animals don’t need morality.\\r\\n Other animals’ babies are instant survival experts. You know?\\r\\n Like a baby elephant. You seen one? That thing just falls out of its mum.\\r\\n [splats]\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Then it just gets up and just starts walking.\\r\\n Like it’s catching up with a pub crawl, “Oh, shit, sorry, everyone. It’s fine.\\r\\n No, it’s fine. Sorry.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I thought I left my phone, but I got it.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’d love a cork in my balls.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’d love a cork in my balls. Because, ladies, I am an ally.\\r\\n [women whooping]\\r\\n Just kidding. That was a test, you failed.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Never trust a man who says that.\\r\\n Yes. That was a test and you passed.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Never trust a man that says that. He’s probably lying!\\r\\n Just because a person claims to be something,\\r\\n does not mean they are that particular something.\\r\\n And you can take that from me.\\r\\n Miss Nigeria 2015.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Hard to be an ally now. Everyone’s got to be a very good person.\\r\\n It’s hard. I’ve realized I’m not a good person.\\r\\n I’m not a good person. I’m not a bad person,\\r\\n but I’m not selfless enough to be a good person. You know?\\r\\n Over the course of this pandemic, we’ve seen what it takes to be good.\\r\\n You gotta give shit up to look after others. I won’t do that.\\r\\n I’m not a good person. I’m not a bad person, before you worry.\\r\\n I’m not a bad person. I’m in between.\\r\\n Like, for example, I once accidentally sat on a cat.\\r\\n All right?\\r\\n It was an accident!\\r\\n But I didn’t get up straight away. You know, that’s…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’s where I am on the spectrum.\\r\\n I knew it was wrong, but I took my time.\\r\\n But I’m decent, you know. I’m a decent guy.\\r\\n I wouldn’t go out of my way to hurt anyone,\\r\\n but I wouldn’t go out of my way to help them either.\\r\\n I just wouldn’t go out of my way.\\r\\n That’s my moral code. If you’re falling over, I’ll catch you,\\r\\n but you need to be falling onto me, pretty much.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Got a bad back. Can’t be running around catching fools.\\r\\n It’s okay to be decent. Especially if you’re a guy.\\r\\n We’ve made it pretty easy for ourselves.\\r\\n We’ve sp',\n","  'ent centuries, us guys, lowering the moral bar for ourselves\\r\\n so all that’s required for us to be one of the good ones is to not be bad.\\r\\n It’s harder for women. Women are held to a higher ethical standard.\\r\\n I think the word “decent” illustrates this clearly.\\r\\n If you’re a decent guy, that’s a compliment.\\r\\n Notice that? “You gotta meet my friend Paul. He’s a decent guy.”\\r\\n “Shit! Let’s get a drink with Paul now!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Every second without Paul is a living nightmare!\\r\\n Where are you, Paul?!”\\r\\n There just seems to be more weight to the word “decent” if it’s a man.\\r\\n Like, if you went to a man’s funeral,\\r\\n you know, and the priest said,\\r\\n “Alan was a decent man.”\\r\\n You’d be like, “[gasps] Oh, no!\\r\\n Alan sounded like a great guy!\\r\\n Aw, I should’ve hung out more with Alan!\\r\\n Now I’ve missed out on all that sweet Alan time.\\r\\n Rest in peace, you hero. See you up there.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n If you went to a woman’s funeral, and the priest said,\\r\\n “Susie was a decent woman.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You’d be like: “Ugh.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Susie wasn’t trying, was she?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Sounds like your heart wasn’t in it, Suze!\\r\\n What did you die of? A lack of effort? Christ!\\r\\n Put her in the ground. Let’s have some sandwiches.”\\r\\n It’s difficult to be a good person all the time.\\r\\n It’s difficult to feel like a good person. All the time at the moment.\\r\\n I don’t feel like a good person at the moment.\\r\\n Especially in the wake of this COVID pandemic, I feel…\\r\\n It sounds silly.\\r\\n …a little responsible for it all.\\r\\n Because if we’re out to believe the leading theory,\\r\\n this pandemic, this virus, started in a meat market in China.\\r\\n So if you’re being lazy and a bit racist about the whole thing,\\r\\n you could blame the pandemic on two groups of people,\\r\\n Chinese people and meat eaters.\\r\\n Now, I don’t know about you, but I am both of those things.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’m a Chinese meat eater.\\r\\n All right. One of those things I can’t change.\\r\\n Obviously. No matter how hard I try, I can’t do anything about.\\r\\n And the other would require some sort of\\r\\n facial reconstruction to look less Chinese.\\r\\n [laughing and applauding]\\r\\n It sounds expensive and painful.\\r\\n Yeah. Gotta hand it to the vegans, though.\\r\\n They were right the whole time, the vegans.\\r\\n You shouldn’t cram animals unnaturally close to one another.\\r\\n It’ll all end in tears.\\r\\n And they’ve been proved right in the most dramatic way imaginable.\\r\\n And to their credit,\\r\\n they have seen this opportunity for a huge worldwide I-told-you-so,\\r\\n and they let it pass.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n With uncharacteristic grace.\\r\\n But I think that’s ’cause deep down, they’re smug about the whole thing.\\r\\n They’re being quietly smug because they know this is their world now.\\r\\n This is the world of the vegan now. The COVID era is the age of the vegan.\\r\\n Because who better equipped to thrive in the coronavirus age\\r\\n than someone for whom a loss of taste would be a blessed relief.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [whooping and applauding]\\r\\n “Pass me the mushroom burger, baby! I’ve tested positive!\\r\\n We’re having seconds tonight.”\\r\\n I’m not a vegan myself. I’ve given it a good go.\\r\\n I gave veganism ',\n","  'a good go\\r\\n over the course of a meal.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’ve decided, that instead, to offset my carbon footprint,\\r\\n I will just die 20 years early.\\r\\n There’s an old Buddhist proverb that goes, “A short life well-lived\\r\\n is better than a long one with quinoa.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n And I think there’s a lot of wisdom in those old texts.\\r\\n I’ve been trying to eat healthier.\\r\\n I’ve been trying to get slimmer, fitter, healthier.\\r\\n Working out and all that.\\r\\n I’ve let go of the, uh, comforting, but rather spurious idea\\r\\n that a person’s physical appearance is of no importance at all.\\r\\n It’s not everything,\\r\\n but it’s not nothing either.\\r\\n There’s a happy medium somewhere in between.\\r\\n But I used to comfort myself with all these old platitudes, you know.\\r\\n Doesn’t matter how I look on the outside, it’s who I am on the inside that counts.\\r\\n It turned out who I was on the inside was having trouble breathing.\\r\\n So…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Even the most well-meaning ideologies have their practical limits.\\r\\n So I started working out, put some work in,\\r\\n started working out, exercising. I lost some weight.\\r\\n Lost a good bit of weight. I lost some weight.\\r\\n [silence]\\r\\n Thank you!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Appreciate it. Really kind. Made it all worth it. Thanks.\\r\\n Lost some weight recently, lost a good bit.\\r\\n Mainly from my, uh, dick, which is a shame.\\r\\n [groans]\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Never know where it’s gonna come off, do you?\\r\\n You always hope it’s your belly or jawline. For me, it’s my penis.\\r\\n This is my body now.\\r\\n This is my physique.\\r\\n I’m content. I’m content with this body.\\r\\n I’m not happy.\\r\\n Don’t worry, I’ve not lost my mind. I’m not happy with my body.\\r\\n But I’m content, you know.\\r\\n We’re under too much pressure to be happy with our bodies.\\r\\n It’s not really the job of your body to make you happy.\\r\\n Because what is your body? Your body is just a compromise you’ve made\\r\\n between the lifestyles you want to live at the same time.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You know?\\r\\n What is your body? Your body is the intersection\\r\\n between your ideal…\\r\\n and your effort. Right?\\r\\n This is my body. This is not the body I want.\\r\\n I want a better body.\\r\\n But this is how much I want that body.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [applauding]\\r\\n It’s not like I’ve had no say in the matter.\\r\\n Just trying to look good. Started working out. Gone to the gym.\\r\\n [woman whoops]\\r\\n Started working out. Thank you!\\r\\n I started doing, uh, Pilates.\\r\\n [women whooping]\\r\\n Yeah, that’s right.\\r\\n Old Philates Wang over here.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I love the Philates.\\r\\n Gotta get on the ol’ Pilates, everyone. Pilates for the back, you see.\\r\\n If you don’t know what Pilates is, uh, Pilates is basically atheist yoga.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n That’s all it seems to be. Pilates.\\r\\n I’ve been doing it a while now. It’s just atheist yoga.\\r\\n It’s yoga without all the fuckin’, you know, ghosts!\\r\\n There’s none of that.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n None of that in Pilates.\\r\\n [applauding]\\r\\n Pilates is more like,\\r\\n “Bend over the stick. There is no God!” That’s Pilates.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I think it’s German.\\r\\n Started, uh, doing Pilates. Trying to look better.\\r\\n Trying to look better in my thirties. 31.\\r\\n Trying to catch the pieces',\n","  ' as they fall off, put them back in place.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’ve started getting better haircuts. This is better, believe it or not!\\r\\n I used to be a real cheapskate with the haircuts.\\r\\n I used to go down to the nearest Lebanese guy, give him 10 pounds\\r\\n and he’d throw a pair of scissors at my head.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’d hope for the best.\\r\\n I live in the Lebanese part of London. I don’t hunt down Lebanese people.\\r\\n Now I go a bit further afield to an East Asian barber.\\r\\n Now, East Asian hair is quite a unique beast.\\r\\n It needs the appropriate lived experience. You know?\\r\\n So I go to an East Asian barber now. I go to a Japanese place.\\r\\n Because I forgive them.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You know, Nanking was a while ago. PlayStation’s pretty good. Fair enough.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I like my barber. Cool guy.\\r\\n My barber Tucker. Cool guy, Tucker.\\r\\n Cool Japanese barber.\\r\\n I like Tucker. We have good conversations while I’m in the chair.\\r\\n He’s, uh, got very good English, Tucker. He’s been in the UK a few years now.\\r\\n But he still has a strong Japanese accent. And understandably, from time to time,\\r\\n he will not know the English word that he’s reaching for.\\r\\n But for some reason, he does know the English word,\\r\\n “whatchamacallit.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I don’t know how, where he learned this word.\\r\\n But I’m so glad he did.\\r\\n Because it imbues all our conversations with magic.\\r\\n So I’ll be sat in his chair. He’ll be cutting my hair.\\r\\n He’ll just be telling me about his weekend.\\r\\n He’ll just go like,\\r\\n [in Japanese accent] “I was, uh, watching TV\\r\\n in my apartment\\r\\n sitting on my sofa…\\r\\n and I saw an advert for the…\\r\\n [groans]\\r\\n Whatchamacallit…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Whatchamacallit…”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [in normal voice] There’s no point to this story. I just think it’s funny\\r\\n when he says, “whatchamacallit.”\\r\\n It’s a good word to know if you don’t know other words.\\r\\n It catches a lot of them. Classic Japanese efficiency there.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I feel like some of you got uncomfortable when I did a Japanese accent.\\r\\n Which is, of course, insane.\\r\\n But I understand. These are racially fractious times, aren’t they?\\r\\n Hard to know what is right and wrong.\\r\\n What is acceptable and what is not. What you can laugh at and what you can’t.\\r\\n And far be it for me to expect you to take an unnecessary risk for my benefit.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n So you are forgiven. However,\\r\\n for future reference,\\r\\n and to protect you from future cowardice, I…\\r\\n For future reference, I’ve come up with some rules.\\r\\n Some rules of thumb to help you decide in the moment\\r\\n whether or not it is morally acceptable to do another person’s accent.\\r\\n Would you like to hear the rules?\\r\\n [all] Yeah!\\r\\n Of course you would, you fuckin’ bigots!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n So the first rule is, the umbrella rule, the catchall rule is,\\r\\n if it’s a good accent…\\r\\n [laughing]\\r\\n play ball.\\r\\n That’s fair. If it’s a good accent, if you put in the time,\\r\\n research and practice\\r\\n to really nail that sucker down,\\r\\n I don’t think anyone has any right to complain.\\r\\n What can they even say?\\r\\n “Hey, come on, that’s bang on.” What can they say?\\r\\n Fuck it.\\r\\n [applauding]\\r\\n If it’s a good accent, ha',\n","  've at it.\\r\\n Now, that doesn’t cover me in every situation.\\r\\n So the second rule is,\\r\\n if the accent in question belongs to a people\\r\\n who at any time had an empire…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n or were on the naughty side during the war…\\r\\n they’re not allowed to complain either!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now, this gets you more accents than you think.\\r\\n You get the obvious ones,\\r\\n like English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, German, blah, blah, blah.\\r\\n But you get fun ones too!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You get Japanese.\\r\\n You get, uh, Italian.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n You get Turkish. You get Russian.\\r\\n You get Egyptian.\\r\\n You get Chinese! Yeah!\\r\\n Might not be expecting old Wang to give you this green light, but…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I’m hoist with my own petard, yeah.\\r\\n China is on a perpetual imperial mission, taking over the world.\\r\\n You’re allowed to do a Chinese accent. We’re strong enough. Uh, we can take it.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n I don’t give a shit when someone does a Chinese accent. Water off a Wang’s back.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n The eagle does not concern himself with the impressions of the worm.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Couldn’t care less when people do Chinese accents.\\r\\n Don’t care. My friends seem to care. My white woke friends care very much\\r\\n when someone does an offensive Chinese accent.\\r\\n They’ll tell me about people doing offensive Chinese accents.\\r\\n I’ve never asked them to.\\r\\n But apparently I have this network of terrified spies…\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n …who just rush off into the world, get offended on my account and rush back to report.\\r\\n “[whimpering] Did you see? That celebrity did a Chinese accent!\\r\\n Piers Morgan did a Chinese accent.\\r\\n Gigi Hadid on Instagram, she did the eyes. I won’t do them now, but she did the eyes.\\r\\n Aren’t you sad? Aren’t you offended? Do you feel diminished? You’ll be okay.”\\r\\n [mumbles, then groans]\\r\\n We’re going to kill all of you.\\r\\n [laughing and applauding]\\r\\n We don’t want to remember who did it, who didn’t do it…\\r\\n Whatever. Enjoy! Whatever, who cares. Enjoy.\\r\\n We’re busy, actually.\\r\\n Don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we’re busy.\\r\\n Handle your own HR, we’re busy!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n We’re flying to the moon. Raking over your footprints. We’re busy.\\r\\n Taking thousands of photos of your city centers for reconnaissance.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n We’re busy.\\r\\n “Oh, just a tourist, just a tourist.”\\r\\n [laughing and applauding]\\r\\n [in Mandarin] Ready, fire!\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [in English] We’re going to eat you all.\\r\\n And you won’t even be the weirdest shit we ate that day.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Guys, thank you so much for coming out.

Look at you.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Look at you. You made a little plan for yourself. And you stuck with it. You didn’t cancel. I know you wanted to cancel. I know it. I know it. I almost did too.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Texting each other, “We still gonna go to the thing?” “Yeah. Don’t you want to go?” “No, I do. I’m just seeing if there’s any weakness on your part.” I will tear this night down.\\r\\n [laughs] [applause]\\r\\n Be home with my pants off all night. That’s all you want. You just want to be home with your pants off. Oh, it’s the best feeling in the world. And you only get it if you cancel. Oh, there’s no better feeling in the world than canceling. Oh! It’s the best! Just going from “I have to do something” to “I’m not doing anything.” Oh, what a dream. Canceling dinner plans with another couple? Oh, heaven. “You think we can cancel on ’em?” “Yes. “I don’t have to listen to him talk or watch her chew. Yes.” Oh, canceling the gym? Oh, that one’s sweet. You don’t even have to call anyone. Just do it in your head. “I’m not going.” Done.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Oh, it’s the best. Snow days? Remember snow days? Oh! It’s the best. God canceling everything on everybody. More powerful than your parents. “I want to go to school, but I can’t. God won’t let us.”\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n Yeah, it’s a hard thing, not to cancel, and you didn’t cancel, and you made it, and it means a lot, and I thank you.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Sincerely. What else you gonna do, really? What are you gonna do, stay home? Watch the news? Watch more news? You gonna watch more news? That’s a treat. Now, are you scared? Are you guys scared? Everybody’s scared now. Are you scared? Yeah? ‘Cause you watch too much news. Turn it off. Go to a show. Look, some things are scary. I’ll give it to you. Uh, no grown-ups left, that’s kind of scary. There’s no one left to fight the bad guys. There’s adult coloring books now. Adult coloring books. And they’re popular. I saw a man–a man– a grown man– on the floor of an airport. A man laying on his stomach on the floor of an airport, just coloring, just– Why even wear pants? Why? You’re not a man. You’re a baby man. My friend’s like, “No, Tom, you don’t understand. “They are adult. I have one. It’s a ‘Game of Thrones’ coloring book.” My apologies. I thought it was something childish, like “The Hobbit.” I didn’t know it was “Game of Thrones.” That must be hard, with all the snow in that show. Having to use the white crayon? You never really know if it’s working or not. No one can deal. How about these people with the fake service dogs? You see these creeps? Fake service– there’s real service dogs that help real people. Then a girl shows up with a Pekinese sticking out of a Hello Kitty handbag and acts like it’s working. And how little do you have to think of yourself to scam a certificate and show it at the gate? “I have to have this puppy with me on this flight, or I’m gonna lose my marbles.” “Oh, by all means. Welcome aboard.” What could possibly go wro',\n","  'ng with your crazy ass… at 40,000 feet? I got on a flight the end of last year. There was a woman next to me. I’m not making any of this up. Middle seat. She turned to me, and she had a Chihuahua in a BabyBjorn. I swear to–head, penis, legs, and dog arms. The look of humiliation in this animal’s face… He was just like, “I apologize. “We normally walk. “We’ve been walking up till now. “I’m gonna have to get pants. “This is upsett– I can’t reach.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [sighs] Look, it’s easy to scare human beings. We scare easy. We’re a timid creature, you know? We–my wife is one of those people that gets frightened in restaurants if you don’t give her exact directions to the bathroom. You have these people in your life? “Where is it? Where?” “It’s back there, to the right.” “But where? Has anyone gone? Has anyone gone?” “No, just follow a wall. You’ll get there.” Seriously, has anyone not come back? Has anyone not come back? “I miss Grandpa.” “Me too.” “We shouldn’t have taken him to the Applebee’s and let him go by himself.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Look, you get scared, but keep your eye on the ball. You know, you have to have perspective. Are you afraid of ISIS? You think ISIS is coming to your house? Are they coming to your house? No. Keep your eye on the ball. There’s so many other ways you could die.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n You drove here tonight. You made it here. You still got to get back. These roads are crazy. You should be scared of moms in Honda Odysseys. That’s who you should be scared of, not some guy dressed up like a ninja from Party City running around Yemen. Keep it in perspective. Look, life is stressful. It’s hard being a human being. It’s hard. It’s hard getting through life. I understand. I had a hard day today as well. My whole day today was spent trying not to eat nachos. That was my whole day. No, they’re bad for me, I shouldn’t eat them, and I can’t stop. And I ate them again. I ate them again. Gas station nachos today.\\r\\n [crowd groans]\\r\\n Oh, back off. Your fancy Cleveland farm-to-table nacho attitude.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n You think a drug addict cares where he gets his drugs? No. He just gets them, and he puts them in his body. Look, I’m not an animal. I didn’t wake up and say, “I’m eating nachos today.” I woke up. I said, “No, today’s the day. No nachos. We’re not doing it.” But that’s a different guy making those decisions. That’s Morning Tom who says those things. Oh, no, you’d like Morning Tom. He’s a winner. He’s a winner. Oh, Morning Tom, he puts on workout clothes, returns emails, makes fruit smoothies. Fruit smoothies. Gets a blender, puts in protein powder. Neeeeeeeee! Stare down my weak family eating Fruit Loops. Neeeeeeee! “You guys are losers. You know that, right? “All three of you. You’re looking at a winner right here.” We all are in the morning. There’s a different you coming out right now. In the morning, you’re clear-eyed and focused. That’s why you never hit on anyone in the morning. You got to wait till late at night, when they’re confused and tired. They got to lay down somewhere; might as well be with you.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n No one has ever gotten laid in the history of mankind at the breakfast buffet. “I’ll be back for waffles.” But that’s okay. That’s all right, you know? Problem is, morning time doesn’t last very long. Passes out around 2:00. ',\n","  'And the guy that wakes up in his place is a very different guy. He is not a winner. That guys is not–he’s an alcoholic, is what he is. Takes that same blender and fills it up with margarita mix and tequila.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now my kids are looking at me. “Who’s the loser now?” Drunk at 3:00. And he’s a liar. He’ll say anything to get me to drink, anything. “Come on. Just have one. “Have one. You deserve it. You deserve it.” That’s all I got to hear. “Yeah, you’re right. I do deserve it. “Yeah, I worked hard this week. I fixed the toilet too. “You don’t hear that running anymore, no. “I did that. “I took the lid off the back. “I put my hand in that creepy water. “I touched the chain with the grass on it. “I did that. “And it’s fixed. “It’s gonna stay fixed… “as long as you use the other bathroom. “Just use the other toilet. I’m not sure what the hell I did.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n And then he–please. Then he just comes at you. “Come on. Come on. “If you have one, you gonna stop at one? “You can’t stop at one. You think Sinatra ever stopped at one?” “Yeah, you’re right. “I’m just like Sinatra too, “without the songs and the money. All right.” And then three hours later, I’m just wandering around my house drunk, with a phone in my hand. “I wonder if Panda Express makes nachos.” But that’s okay. You have to have perspective in your life. You have to enjoy yourself. You can’t work crazy all the time. What difference does it make? You got to enjoy yourself. You know, if you worked all the time, what would be different? Nothing. Nothing. At this point in your life, don’t you realize how much you’re going to affect the world? Don’t you realize…\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n What you’re going to accomplish? Calm down.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Really. And that’s all right. Don’t compare yourself to the people who change the world. They’re freaks, genetic freaks. Steve Jobs, Edison– freaks. First of all, no sleep. No sleep. Three hours of sleep a night, those guys. Three. I’m out. I’m out. I need a lot of sleep. Sometimes I wake up in the morning, my first thought is, “I don’t think I can get a nap today.” I don’t even know if I’m tired. I don’t even know if I slept last night. I haven’t even opened my eyes. I know I peed five times. I don’t know if I REM’d out at the end. And it’s not a lazy thing; it’s a genetic condition. I come from a long line of nappers. The Papa family naps. My whole childhood was waking up adults to ask them stuff. They would just lay around the living room like a pile of sea lions.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n “Dad, Dad. “Dad. Can I go to Keith’s house?” [long moan] “Grandma, Grandma, can I go to Keith’s house?” [long moan] “She moved her whiskers. That’s yes. Let’s go.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n And so what? So you don’t work all the time. What’s gonna happen? How’s your life gonna change? What, you’re not gonna be part of the super-rich? Is that what’s gonna happen? [muttering] First of all, that shouldn’t be a goal. It doesn’t change your life at all. And second of all, the list of people with all the money shrinks every year. It’s down to ten people now. In two years, it’s gonna be, like, Bob. Bob has all the money. Everybody, just sleep in. Take the whole summer off. Bob’s got all the money. And it shouldn’t be a goal. It’s just this abstract thing that you just keep chasing, you',\n","  ' know? I’ve–personally, never a goal. I don’t need a lot of money. I can live a poet’s life. I really, sincerely could. Don’t need money. Don’t need stuff. Always giving it away. I could move every week. I really could. But, uh, I do not live alone. [chuckles] I’m married, and I have two children, and they are greedy, capitalist pigs.\\r\\n [laughter and applause]\\r\\n “More, more, more.” “Whaaa.” “I want food with every meal.” “Whaaa.” So I work hard. All my money goes to them. Every damn penny goes to these people. I live in a horrible school district in L.A. now, and it was either pay for school or guns and ammo. And they have no skills or coordination, so I’m paying for school. Goes against everything I believe in, but I’m paying for school. My only rule for paying for school is, I won’t pay for any school that is predominantly Asian. Why? Why would I pay all of that money for my kids to be last in everything? We can’t compete. These families are dominant. They kick ass. We can’t compete. They’re straight-A students. These kids play five instruments, five. They’re walking to school. They have an oboe and a violin and a drum kit. The dad’s pushing a baby grand piano across the parking lot. My kids play the toilet paper roll. Literally, we just walk around the house. [imitating horn playing music] “I think you got it, honey.” [imitating horn] “I don’t think you have to practice anymore. “Get some Pop-Tarts. Sit on the couch. Enjoy your life.” They beat us everywhere we go. I put the little one on the swim team. I figure we have a chance there, right? Let’s go to the pool. That’s an Asian-free zone. Let’s try it. Not anymore. They dominated every other sport. Now they’re at the pool. But my kid’s big. She’s got a back like Michael Phelps. I’m like, “We can take ’em. Come on. We can do this.” They hit the gun. Their kids took off like speed boats. My kid, two strokes, drowned right in their wake. We scooped her out, resuscitated her, put her right back on the couch. And we quit that night. We quit that night. She was like, “I thought we’re not allowed to quit things, Dad.” “Yeah, well, I’m not gonna be humiliated “like that again. “I’m not gonna ruin my Saturdays “and sit through that. “Yeah, you lay there “and think about what you might be good at, and we’ll try again.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Now–so I’m not gonna be part of the super-rich, and I have news for you. Uh, you’re not either.\\r\\n [laughter]\\r\\n They don’t do this. They don’t come out to the ass end of Cleveland, sit in the dark, and listen to jokes.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n They do different things. They summer. They summer. They summer. Do you summer? I don’t summer. Summer happens, and I deal with it. Just stay in the shade and walk slow. No, they buy all white, a whole white wardrobe on Memorial Day to go summer. I can’t wear white. I bought a white shirt last year. I sweat through it in 20 minutes. It looked like I was smuggling turkey gravy under my armpits. Yeah, I should have thrown it out, but I spent 20 bucks for it at Old Navy. I’m gonna wear it. I just kept my arms in the reason of the season. No, we don’t summer. We don’t wear all white. My family doesn’t have parties in the middle of a wheat field. We don’t have a dining room table in the middle of a field where food just falls from the heavens and everyone’s beautiful an',\n","  'd the dad stands up and quotes Shakespeare and everybody laughs, ’cause they get it. That is not my family. We go to my sister’s picnic table. We eat egg salad sandwiches. We push Grandma in the kiddie pool, and her tit pops out. That’s what we laugh at. That’s what we get. “Oh, Grandma, your titteth has poppethed out. To be or not to be in a home.” I say we keep her. She’s hilarious. Puts sponges in the toaster. Who does that?\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Look, there’s nothing wrong with making money, right? You want to make money. You have to make money. I’m not saying you want to be poor. We’ve all been there, right? When I started comedy out of college, I made five bucks a night, five, in New York. I needed the money. It was fun times, but everything smelled like hot dogs, everything. I did. My girlfriend did. It was like, “Are we making hot dogs again?” “No, that’s us. We got to get jobs. This is not working out. We smell weird.” But how much is enough? You know what I mean? How much is enough? Do you really need a mansion? Who needs a mansion? Who needs a mansion? If you have 80 children, you should have a mansion, right? If you have 80 children, you need that square footage. You know what these places look like, ’cause they come in the beautiful real estate section of the Sunday paper, this beautiful magazine filled with mansions. Why? Why are you putting that in the poor people newspaper? Who’s couponing and looking for a mansion in the same paper?\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n They always have those perfect kitchens, the beautiful island with a fruit bowl with a pyramid of perfect green apples. You eat one. A new one just appears out of nowhere, ’cause they have an apple boy. They have an apple boy. Just sits under the kitchen sink and waits. I’ve never even bought a fruit bowl. Have you ever bought a fruit bowl? No. You buy fruit. You need a bowl. You just pick it out of the other bowls. Congratulations, bowl. You’ve been nominated. Say good-bye to your friends. You’re the fruit bowl. And fruit isn’t even the main thing in the fruit bowl. It’s mostly car keys and pennies and garlic skin. One black banana from 1995. No one wants to pick it up, ’cause you know it’s gonna split. So if you have a lot of money and you help people, that’s one thing, but the culture’s devolved into this “I’m better than you” attitude just to have stuff. You know people in your family and friends who just mortgage it, lease it just to say, “I’m better than you,” even if they don’t have it. “Just look at what I have. “Look at my car. It’s newer than yours. “Look at my wife. She’s newer than yours. “She might be older, but she has all new parts. “Where do you shop? The regular supermarket? “That’s disgusting. “I can tell from your skin, “’cause it’s splotchy and gross. “No, I respect it. I just can’t do it. “I only shop at Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s. “That’s where I get my conflict-free M&Ms. Naaah. Naaah.” I’m done with the Whole Foods. I’m done with it. I like eating healthy. I do. But you have to be a billionaire to eat healthy? I’m not spending five bucks on an apple ’cause you thought it was a good idea to ship it from Vermont by bicycle. “Then where you gonna get your kale? How you gonna get your kale?” I don’t know. I don’t care. I don’t even know what it is. My grandmother never made it. My mother never',\n","  ' saw it. It just showed up, like, a week and a half ago. But it’s here now, and you got to eat it. Well, how do I know what it is? ‘Cause it takes like mulch, and you feel like a koala bear when you’re chewing on it. “Are you supposed to eat the stem? Oh, okay.” Hard to tell the eat part from the throw-out part. They get up to the register. They put on a whole show about their bags. “I have my own bags. “I want everyone here to know “I wouldn’t use their bags. “I am an angel sent from heaven. “I wove my own bags out of human hair and seaweed.” Get over yourself. These people have driven me to Costco. That’s the only place I shop now. I go to Costco. Yeah.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Yeah. No one acts like they’re better than you at Costco. Everyone knows exactly who they are at Costco. “I’m disgusting, and I need more stuff immediately. “And I’m making one trip. I brought the big car. This is my only weekend out.” There’s a sense of community when you go to Costco, right? You can’t go there by yourself. You can drive there alone. You’re gonna have to make some friends on your way in. You can’t get a 25-pound salami on your back by yourself. Trying to throw it in your cart like the Scottish strongman competition. The place is so massive, they got to hand out little samples in cups to keep up your strength. It’s like a white trash marathon in that place. “Here’s a fried baloney ball. You’re doing great.”\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n “There’s fried chicken popsicles, aisle ten. You’ll get there by Tuesday if you keep up the pace.” [chuckles] You get to the register. No one’s talking about bags at Costco. They don’t even have bags. They have boxes with holes in it. “There was a dead pig in this yesterday. “I don’t know if that bothers you. “The cardboard’s a little wet. He was a bleeder.” And they know they’re not gonna live forever at Costco. They have coffins at the door. They literally sell coffins at the door, which sounds absurd until you look in your cart filled with Cheez-Its and Slim Jims. You’re like, “How much longer can I live like this? “Seriously? “You know what? Today’s the day. “I’m buying a coffin today. “You know what? Give me the coffin. “I’m gonna use it as my box. Put all my stuff in there.” Wheel it–\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Look, I don’t even blame you if you’re one of the Costco people or the Whole Foods people. It’s not even up to you anymore, right? You go to a store once, they take so much information from you, you end up in this long-term relationship with these companies. Back off. I deal with human beings. That’s enough. I’m not dating you, CVS. Every time I go to CVS, “Do you have your card? “Do you have your CVS card? Do you have your card?” “No, for the tenth time this week. No, I don’t have a card.” “You don’t have a card? “This man doesn’t have a card! “This man doesn’t have a card. You’ve got to join us.” People coming out of the back, “Join us. Join us.” “No, I don’t want to join you. “I don’t want anything on my keychain. “I didn’t want to make eye contact with you, frankly. “I just want to sneak in here, get this ointment, go home, and deal with this.”\\r\\n [laughter] [applause]\\r\\n “Do you take money? “I’ll pay you money. “I’ll pay you double if you let me leave. “I should be home with my pants off, solving this problem right now.” When you don’t join up, they act like a psy',\n","  'chotic girlfriend on your way out. “Well, how about your email or your phone number? “We’re not gonna use it; we just want to have it. “We just want to smell it when you’re not here, ’cause we love you.” Back off. Check into the hotel, “Welcome back, Tom.” “Whoa, what do you mean, ‘welcome back’? “You don’t know me. “That’s why I stay with you. You don’t know me. “I know people in town. I don’t stay with them. “They know me. “This is our relationship: “I come in late at night, “I do weird stuff to your towels, “and I leave in the morning. Forget my name.” Every restaurant, they can’t just come up to your table now. They got to bounce up there. “You guys ever eaten here before? You guys ever eaten in an Outback Steakhouse before?” Just lie. “Yeah, I’ve been here before.” They leave, and they get your drink. My wife likes to be honest. “No, I’ve never been in one of these before. What’s gonna happen?” He’s gonna do a show. He’s gonna do a goddamn show. “Let me tell you how it works. “We’re a little crazy at the Outback Steakhouse. “You think you’ve been eating your whole life, “chewing and swallowing? “That’s not what we do here. “You order your appetizer, bring out a cannon, and we shoot it right in your face.” They all have their own credit card now. “Do you have your KFC MasterCard?” “What?” “Do you have your KFC MasterCard?” “No, I don’t have a chicken credit card in my wallet “with a picture of a plantation owner on the side.” “Well, I could save you 15% of your purchase right now if you apply for a KFC MasterCard.” “Yeah, I’m sure the 25 people behind me “wouldn’t mind me filling out some paperwork and running a credit check during their lunch half-hour.” I don’t care about 15% of $8. I don’t care. I just want to sit in the parking lot by myself, eat it quickly before my wife comes out of Banana Republic and sees I’m not following doctor’s orders. Move it. “But if you don’t use the cards, “you’re not gonna get your points. “If you don’t get points, you won’t have status. Don’t you want status?” Don’t fall for it. Don’t fall for it. There’s no such thing as status. It’s all illusion. They try and fool you. Doesn’t matter how many points you have, where you fly on the plane, what you drive. We’re all exactly the same: horrible animals running around in pants, trying to keep ourselves busy, fighting the overwhelming urge to mount each other and make smaller versions of ourselves.\\r\\n [laughter and applause]\\r\\n All the same. But they try and fool ya, right? Flying here, “Okay, we’re gonna board your flight now. “Not everybody. Sit down. “Not all at once, you maniacs. “There’s some special people here “getting on that plane first, ’cause they have status. “We’re gonna start off with our diamond-crusted, “gold-plated, carbon fiber-based, Teflon-coated, “premier, elite-access, super-duper Douchebag Flying Guy Club.” And the whole place stands up. Everybody has it. How special is it? There’s one guy in the other lane with a crooked leg and a cane. “I have no status at all.” And he walks funny, so they board him first anyway. I travel a lot. I travel all the time. I was traveling a lot last year, and I took my family out with me. Figured that would be a good thing. That was– what do you call that? A mistake. That’s a mistake. That is not a good thing. You realize when you travel with ',\n","  'your family, you don’t really know these people all that well. When you’re home, you’re like bees in and out of a hive. You don’t really hang out. And then you wake up that first morning in a hotel room just looking at each other. [chuckles] “You guys are pretty weird, right? “Does the little one always do that? “I didn’t even know we had her. She doesn’t look like any of us.” Big moment this year, though, during the travels. The kids, for the first time in their lives, wheeled their own luggage. Huge, huge milestone. ‘Cause look– yeah, it’s big. It’s a big deal.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n Look, I’ve made my own people, right? I’ve made my own people. I’ve made two people, and I am their leader. I am their leader. So when they want to go somewhere, I have to plan it, because they don’t know where anything is. They think New York and L.A. are right next to each other. I have to pay for everything, ’cause they have no money or skills of any kind. But for years, I would have to carry everything that they owned, like a mule, like a human mule. They would literally load everything on my back and then sit on top of the pile like a small Peruvian lady, and I would just walk through the airport with canteens hitting my legs, just standing at the gate with flies in my eyes. And sometimes you see a donkey with flies in his eyes and you think, “Why doesn’t he get those flies out of his eyes?” Now I know. I’ve seen a donkey’s soul. He doesn’t care about the flies. He hopes the fly eats through his eye and devours the part of his brain that feels and remembers. Oh, but this year, the handle went up, and they just walked ahead. I was crying in the airport, I was so happy. Still can’t pack, though. We got to the hotel. The only thing there was a Curious George and some magnets. Really? Two week’s vacation. You thought that was gonna do it. All right. Hope you like that bathing suit. You’re gonna wear it a lot. And I’m still learning about my wife, still learning about my wife. Oh, I married a talker. I married a talker. 16 years together. Still coming up with new stuff to say every goddamn day. She starts from the minute she gets up till about a half-hour after she falls asleep. Just talks… She’ll talk to anybody. The housekeeper at the hotel doesn’t speak any English at all. My wife doesn’t care. “Then my mother said she didn’t like my hair. Can you believe that?” This poor woman’s like, “Oh, no. Terrible.” Then we come home. She starts talking to the cats. Cats, they don’t speak any language at all. My wife just sees two ears, like, “I should fill those with talking noises. “How many times have I told you not to go on the counter? We talk about this every day.” Cat’s like, “Meow, meow. That’s terrible. Meow.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n Went to Disney for the first time, a trip to Disney. That was, uh– that was rough. That was rough. That is not a good place. They call it “the happiest place on Earth.” For who? For who? Ugh! Look, I love the idea. I love the idea that this man created something out of his own head. He just wanted to create a nice little place where families can go and kids can let their imagination run wild and feel safe for a couple hours in this horrible world. Beautiful idea. But what he couldn’t foresee when he was developing it in 1950 was the type of people it was going to attract in 2016 in t',\n","  'he United States of America, ’cause they didn’t make these kind of people back then. There weren’t dinosaur-sized people stomping through the park with their elephant children attached to their tail… Pushing the biggest strollers I’ve ever seen. I had no idea John Deere made strollers. One woman had five kids in it. Fi–I never–I don’t know what you even call that. A pentalometer? A jumbotron? Five pumpkin-faced kids eating cheeseburgers, and she’s plowing through the crowd, knocking other families out of the way like tumbleweeds just so she can get to the churro stand first. Then there are people there, women, who have no children at all, who want to be a princess themselves. Grown women who want to be a princess. They want to dress like Cinderella, but they don’t make a Cinderella dress for someone 48 years old, 6’5″, 380. They never had a meeting and said, “Let’s make more of those.” Does that stop them? No, it does not. They buy that dress. They stuff everything they have into it, and a lot doesn’t fit. There’s a lot of extra hanging over the sides. But that’s okay. They’re happy there. They have their autograph book and their wand, and they skip through the park. Fine. Honestly, I didn’t think I was gonna fall for it. I didn’t. I didn’t think we were gonna do. I didn’t. But once you make your own people, the ads just find you. Every time you open your phone, open your laptop, turn on TV, there they are, just selling you joy and perfection, right? Every time you turn it on, the mom and dad are beautiful, perfect teeth and hair, clothes. “I love you.” “No, I love you.” “You’re beautiful.” “No, you’re beautiful.” “Our kids are beautiful.” And the kids are holding Mickey’s hand, looking back at the parents. “Thanks, Mom and Dad, for not being stupid and poor.” I’ll admit it; I wanted to be that family. I wanted to be that family. We were not that family. We didn’t come close. We were not perfect. We were sweaty and pissed off and cursing in front of the children. “This is your damn fault. “If your parents didn’t raise you like an animal, we would have left a little bit earlier.” And the kids don’t even hear us, ’cause they’re slapping each other in the face. And we haven’t even parked yet. We haven’t even parked. We’re still in the van. We’re pissed off ’cause we didn’t get to park in Mickey and Minnie parking. They sent us with that big hand to the ass end of Chip and Dale parking. That’s another tram ride we didn’t plan for. Then you get to the front of the park. I know it’s a cliché, but you get up there. You open your wallet. They take everything you got. Everything– every dollar, every coin, every credit card, gym memberships, pictures of your family, unused condoms. That mouse rapes you at the turnstile, and you have to plaster a smile on your face in front of your kids, ’cause you don’t want to ruin the happiest place on Earth. “It’s gonna be a great… day, guys. It’s really gonna be a lot of fun.” Then you get inside. It’s just line after line after line. I thought I was gonna beat it. I had the app on my phone. I’m like, “I’m gonna beat ’em.” No, you’re not beating Disney. I’m like, “Let’s go on the Peter Pan ride. “That’s a horrible ride from 1912. “Look, no one wants to even go on it. The line only goes back and forth two times.” Yeah, up here. Then they take you to ',\n","  'the basement. It loops around for three days. Then they shoot you out the ass end. It goes around the Matterhorn 12 times. And it’s a bad ride. It’s a bad ride. Old cardboard cutouts, Christmas lights that don’t even work anymore. All the voices are jumbled. [distorted] “I’m Tinker Bell. I’m Tinker Bell.” 2 1/2 hours! Was it worth it? No. What would be worth it? Nothing. I get to the end of that line, there could be naked supermodels with bags of money and all-you-can-eat nachos. I’d be like, “No, not into it. You lied to me.” [chuckles] Here’s what I learned, though. Here’s what I learned. If you go ahead and go–and if you make your own people, you’re gonna have to go– you just want to go once. You want to go once, so you got to blow it out, make it all about the kids, go big. Give ’em your money. “Here’s $300 cash, kids. “Spend it the way you want to spend it. It’s your day.” And halfway up Main Street, they’ll be broke, ’cause they’re small, and they’re stupid and gullible. And they’re going to buy a lot of blinking stuff that’s not gonna work by the time they get outside. And now they’re laying in the gutter of Main Street like little Disney hobos, broken toys, crying, just yelling at the characters. “Get over here, duck, and shake your ass. I got nothing left.” Make sure you fill them with sugar, a lot of sugar. Make them tweak out on sugar. Don’t even have to wear sunblock. “How about that, kids? “You hate when I put it on you. “I don’t want to put it on you. “Don’t wear it. I bet you don’t even burn in Disney.” They do burn, especially when they’re little. They turn purple, and they start to blister. And now they’re crying. They got broken toys. They’re crashing on sugar. And this is when you walk ’em. You got to walk the hell out of ’em. Give ’em the map. “Anywhere you want to go.” “Oh, you want to go from the Cars ride “to It’s a Small World? “Sure, 20 miles apart. Let’s start walking.” Midnight rolls around. They’ve been on two rides the whole day. We’ll never go back again. My kids see that mouse now, they shake like they went to war with it.\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n I like moving around, especially by myself. You get to see a lot of people, and it’s inspirational. You know, people are good, and they’re kind, and they look out for each other. And–yeah, I actually like people more the older I get. When I was younger, I didn’t like people so much, and now, you know, you realize, “We’re all the same, you know?” You pee on your own leg more than three times a week. You’re like, “How great am I?” You know? And that’s another thing I don’t understand about the wealth. I mean, what’s the thing? What’s the goal? To just get so much money, you isolate yourself from everybody else? Just go from your helicopter to your island and back to your place? Why? We’re only here once. You got to mix it up, you know? Look, I’m not Pollyannaish about it. I mean, sometimes I get around people in a crowd, I wish I had my own helicopter. Not just to fly away. I would turn it upside down and chop everyone’s head off.\\r\\n [laughter and applause]\\r\\n Sometimes. But for the most part, people are cool, and they look out for each other, and it’s nice, you know? And the only bad part: it only takes one person who doesn’t know how to act among us to ruin the good time of everyone else, some disgusting behavior, ',\n","  'and it ruins the good time of everybody, ’cause they’re breaking the human contract, which is very simple. You’re abiding by it right now. So when we get around each other, just turn it down a notch. Don’t do publicly what you like to do privately. When you’re alone, it gets kind of weird. That’s okay. You’re an animal. There’s only so long you can not put a finger in one of your openings. That’s okay. Hey, you got a job to do. They don’t make tools for everything you got to get done. Fine. Right now, there’s someone in here that likes filling up his pants with Cheez Doodles and dancing around like a pretty pony. And he’s not doing it. He’s fighting the urge until he gets home. And we respect you for that, sir. We thank you. And I guarantee you it’s a sir. I guarantee you. These other people don’t care. They think the whole world centers around them, disgusting people. They just walk around peeing on things, farting everywhere, letting their dogs go all over your lawn, blowing their nose in the air. Have you ever been around that guy? What the hell? What is– what goes on in your head where you think, “I’ve got something in my nose” and the other part of your brain says, “Blow it out of your face now”? And they’re good at it, which means they practice. Awful people, disgusting people, the same people that curse in front of children, don’t give up their seat for old people, don’t hold the door open for women– awful people. They’re the same people that bring their own smelly-ass food on planes. They apparently think they’re flying alone, and they bring this smelly-ass food that they made in a disgusting laboratory they call a kitchen. Awful. You know who these people are, by the way, ’cause they’re the ones walking through the airport carrying their own pillow from their bed. That’s a psychopath. If you’re a grown-up and you take your pillow out of your bedroom, you better stop at the couch, and you better have the flu. You open the door and take it out into the world with you, you should be caught with a net, and we should never see you again. “Going on a big trip today. “What’s that? You’re so right, pillow. You’re so right.” Look, I don’t think there should be food on a plane at all. How about that, chubsy? How about that? Can you survive without a sandwich? Can you do it? During the Great Depression, we ate nothing but rusty nails and dirt for years. Can you make it to Boise without a sandwich? All right, maybe I’m insensitive. Maybe you have a tapeworm that needs feeding. I don’t know. I don’t know what’s going on inside your gut. But then be nice, something non-offensive. How about an apple, maybe some trail mix? The last flight I was on, a guy broke out a tuna fish and dead skunk ass sandwich. I don’t know what part of Whole Foods has that, but this guy found it, chopped it up with tuna and mayo, and put it on rye. And he waited till the doors were shut and we’re at 10,000 feet. He released this stink bomb like it was a planned attack. You ever smell something so bad that you just get confused? Your head snaps back. You make little circles with your hands. You just blurt something out. “Roosevelt!” [panting] “Just keep breathing out. Just breathe out, out.” “It’s too late. I breathed in. It’s in me. I breathed in. I messed up. It’s in me. I can taste it. I can taste it.” P',\n","  'eople were opening their air vents just to get air from somewhere else. “Oh! Oh! I don’t care if it’s from the engine. Oh!” People were putting their faces in strangers’ armpits for relief. You know what kills me about these situations? All the good people, the social tension of all the nice, cool people. How many other people on the flight? 200? 300 people? So nice, so kind. They don’t even complain. They just sit there and suffer in silence. You’ve never been in that situation and have a guy pop up at the back. “Are you kidding me? “No, honey, let me go. This has to be said. “7:00 in the morning, skunk ass. “Screw you! Oh, I’m the bad guy. All right, all right.”\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n Never. The most you get, people just roll their eyes and whisper. “Pee-yew, he smells. I think it’s skunk ass. I would never do that. That’s terrible.” I’ve got two people that I made. I’ve got two kids. And they’re going through a weird phase. I don’t know if it’s a weird phase. It’s just–my kids are finally realizing I’m not as great as they thought. You know what I mean? Like, for years, I was their god. They were amazed by everything I did. “He gets food. I don’t know how he does it.” “That’s nothing; I saw him lift a chair over his head by himself.” “Wow!” “I know!” The other day, I was yelling at ’em. I mixed up their names. They shot me a look like, “Oh. Maybe our leader’s an idiot. Maybe he’s not kidding when he says he can’t help with our math homework.” And they’re not wrong. I can’t help them anymore. I don’t understand it. But I have to act like it’s a parenting decision for my own ego. They’ll be like, “Dad, can you help me with my math homework?” “No, I’m not giving you the answers. This is between you and your teacher. Work it out.” Then I’m in the bathroom on YouTube, “How do you add fractions with different bottoms? “Oh, you just got to make them the same.” “How?” “Uh…”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n [sighs] My daughter got in the car the other day. She reached over my shoulder. She hit the radio. A whole Taylor Swift station came on that she reprogrammed herself. I’m like, “No, when did you do that?” And I change it. A Katy Perry station comes on. She hijacked the whole radio. I’m like, “When did you do that?” She’s like, “Don’t worry about it. Just make it louder.” Could you imagine? I couldn’t imagine, as a child, getting in my father’s car, demanding my music, and then, “Louder. Lower. A little louder. Right there, Chief. Right there.” When I eventually came out of my coma, they would have told me a story of how arrogant I was and why I lost five years of my life when I was hit in the head with a pipe. And as the only man in my house, it’s my job to maintain my importance in the family by teaching my daughters that there are no great guys. That’s my job: to teach my daughters there are no great guys.\\r\\n [scattered applause]\\r\\n Yeah, I believe it. Yeah, there’s a lot of guys applauding that. You know. There’s no great guys. If you think you’re with a great guy tonight, you’re not. Look, American men are as great as you’re gonna get. We fight for equality, and we push strollers. We wear diaper bags. We tell you we want equal pay. But keep in mind it’s an act. It’s an act. Because inside all of us is a 16h-century man who wants to burn the village to the ground. He’s always in there, so just k',\n","  'eep that in mind. If you have a man, you have a wild animal. This is a wild animal, so use him wisely. You’re in control, so don’t do stupid things with your man. Don’t ask us to do certain things. Don’t be stupid. Don’t ask us to watch the children. What are you doing? We’re not really watching the children, not the way you watch the children. We watch them eat bottle caps and fall down stairs. And we laugh. Don’t ask me to shop with my 13-year-old. I shouldn’t be shopping for clothes. I shouldn’t be in Forever 21, waiting for my daughter to come out of the dressing room. No one there knows I have a daughter in the dressing room. They just see a sweaty, uncomfortable man breathing heavy by himself next to the bras and panties. And I shouldn’t pick the young one up from gymnastics. No dad should be picking up his daughter from gymnastics. I shouldn’t be hanging out with the other moms, waiting for it to be over. They’re all talking about juice boxes and play dates. All I’m thinking is, “Which one of these moms would I have sex with first?” I’m being honest. That’s where our head goes. Not which one would I have sex with, by the way, ’cause I’d have sex with all of them. The weird one, the one with the thing on her eye, I’ll make it work. I can make it work. But which one first, while I’ve got the energy? That’s my job, try and give them lessons, but it’s hard, because the real world starts coming in, right? And they start learning about the real world. I try to protect them, but they start learning about all the good and the bad that’s out in the world, and it’s funny in my house, ’cause they’re learning about it at different rates. You know, like, we learned about Thanksgiving, and the little one’s like, “Oh, we love Thanksgiving. “We love the Indians. We gave them our buckle hats and our shoes and a turkey, and they gave us some feathers and some mashed potatoes, and we had dinner with them, and they love us, and we love them.” And the 13-year-old’s just leaning against the refrigerator. “What’s this Trail of Tears I’m hearing about? We took their land and then moved them out west, then took their land again and then killed them all?” And the little one’s like, “It’s not the same Indians, right, Dad?” I’m like, “Yeah, it’s the same Indians.” She’s like, “Why did we do that?” “Oh, easy with the ‘we,’ first of all. We’re the Papas. We’re Italian. We got here in 1945. We eat spaghettis and ride Vespas. We’re lovers.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n But it’s hopeful to see this generation, ’cause they just–they just– you know, they’re more tolerant, and it’s not even tolerant; they don’t have to tolerate it. They don’t even know that things are bad or that they hate each other. They’re just nice and nice people, and it’s very hopeful. They don’t even see race. They don’t say “black people” or “white people.” They just say “darker” or “much darker” or “whiter” or “much whiter” or “gross.” That’s how they talk. The first time my daughter ever heard about race, she saw “The Jackie Robinson Story,” and that really blew her away. She’s like, “Wait a minute. “Are you telling me that white people had to let the black people play baseball?” I was like, “Yeah, that’s how it happened for a while.” She’s like, “No, no, no way. “Isn’t it the black people who let the white people play sports?”\\r\\n [applause]\\r\\n S',\n","  'he’s like–she’s like, “‘Cause I’ve seen some of our white people play basketball. We shouldn’t do that.” And I’m like, “Yeah, they let us play once in a while. “They also let us make music, and that’s where country comes from.”\\r\\n [laughs]\\r\\n The only reason I want a son is because that’s the only thing ruining our good time on the planet. The only time someone loses it and does something awful, 100% of the time, it’s a guy. And I don’t get it, ’cause I was a man… for a while. I was, before I built this vagina tribe that I live in. You really can’t be a man in the vagina tribe. You can’t. I watch the play-offs, but people are putting bows in my hair and doing my nails at the same time. No, angry young men, I really don’t get it. Just calm down, guys. Calm down. You feel like a loser? That’s okay. We all do. We all do. You’re not missing out on anything. We’re all losers. We’re human beings. You get little moments of victories, and most of the time, you lose. That’s okay. That’s the way the whole world works. Travel all around. Everyone’s exactly the same. Thank God you’re not that happy, or I wouldn’t have a job. You’d just sit at home and call your friends. “Ha-ha ha ha ha. Life is wonderful.” No, you have to pay for your laughter, and I am your prostitute.\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n It’s okay. I’m happy to do it. But come on. You’re a young man. Get your life in order. Just get anything. Get a guitar. Get a skateboard. Get a girl. Get a girl. You’re 19. Get an 18-year-old girl. That’s the only age that won’t sound creepy. 19, everything is working full bore. That’s not gonna last. You think everyone’s with supermodels? No. Lower the bar. Lower the bar. Any woman will soothe your soul. Go to a bowling alley. Go to a bowling alley. Go to the back of the bowling alley. There’s a deep fryer in the back of the bowling alley. There’s a girl working that deep fryer. That’s your girl. She’ll be a ton of fun. You’ll get fries and onion rings on the side. Get a cougar. That didn’t exist when I was 19. There weren’t hot, middle-aged women looking for young men to violate. They’re out there now in force. Go to any ladies’ night in any Holiday Inn in Any City, USA. Walk out on the dance floor. Push all the 50-year-old douche bags in their Tommy Bahama out of the way. Raise your arms. “I’m 19.” They will rape you on the dance floor. And look, there are angry young women out there. There’s a lot of angry young women. But they don’t blow stuff up. They just terrorize one guy at a time. They pick one guy out, and they just ruin his life. It’s not nice, but it’s better for the community as a whole. [laughs] But we’re gonna be just fine. And look, look. You have to vote for the right people that are gonna do the right things, and if they don’t do the right things, then you just get them out. That’s just the way it goes. Don’t stress about it. Move it along. That’s the way it goes, ’cause it’s their job. They got to deal with that stuff. We can’t do it. We’re busy. We’re busy, all right? I can’t go out and fight ISIS. My house is crazy. I got enough to deal with in my house, right? You got all your stuff to do. You got to watch LeBron run around. You’ve got to go to games. We’re busy. We’re busy people. I can’t fight ISIS. Neither can you. One of my cats just died. That’s what I’m dealing with. Ye',\n","  'ah. Well, we had three, so two to go. No, I love cats. I love that level of intimacy. I wish my kids were more like cats. That would be perfect. Oh, my God. And please, if I could just leave food for them once a week and they brush against my leg to let me know they’re alive, perfect. Perfect. I don’t even know why we have these animals. Do you? It makes no sense. All these years of engineering and walls and electricity to keep nature out. Then we just open the door like a bouncer. “You two, come on in. No, not you, squirrel, you coke addict. Get out of here.” Then you have an animal just sitting on your counter, looking at you. I was watching TV the other day. My cat, looking at me, dropped its ass, back legs up, front paws, just started pulling itself straight at me, six feet across. Didn’t break eye contact the entire time. Stared me down. “That’s right. My ass in your carpet. What of it? What you gonna do about it, go in my box? I don’t think so. Who’s scooping it out? Not me. Never have, never will.”\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n It’s a crazy house. 16 years putting this whole thing together, and it works. I wish you the same success. I really do. And the family is a good thing. 16 years in the family, 16 years with the same woman, the same person. Good thing. [cheers and applause] It’s good, and it works. But it’s time for a girlfriend. It’s definitely time for a girlfriend. It’s not fair. It’s not fair to my wife. It’s not fair to this woman to expect her to act like a girlfriend for this long; it’s not. Look, when you’re a girlfriend, you’re motivated. You’re excited to see that guy come home. My wife is not that good of an actress. This poor woman has watched me walk from the bedroom to the bathroom in the middle of the night, underwear hanging off my ass, banging into furniture in the dark, for 16 years. How could I expect her to be like, “Oh, goody, I hope he hurries back”?\\r\\n [cheers and applause]\\r\\n I’m out of stories. I’ve run out of stories. You ever hang out with a married couple, the guy starts telling a story, the wife just starts stirring her drink and rolling her eyes? “Here we go again. Blah, blah, blah. We’ve all heard it, Don. We’ve all heard it.” We’re entering that stage. I’m a comedian. She doesn’t think I’m funny. It’s time for a girlfriend. And look, I’m not gonna be sneaky about it. I’m not gonna cheat. I’m gonna sit her down. I’m gonna tell her my plans straight out. I’ll be like, “Look, I found a girl. “She’s young, and she’s dumb. She’s just what we need. She hasn’t heard any of my stories. She thinks I’m hilarious. She wants to fool around all the time. Don’t think of her as my girlfriend. Think of her as your assistant.”\\r\\n Thank you so much, Cleveland. You guys were wonderful.
